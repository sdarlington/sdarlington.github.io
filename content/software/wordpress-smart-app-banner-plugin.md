This is a tiny WordPress plugin that allows you to use the Smart App Banners that were introduced at WWDC 2012 for iOS6 devices. The information to make this plugin, however, was created using [publicly available information](http://www.quora.com/iOS-6/How-will-Smart-App-Banners-work).

In short, you download and activate the plugin. On pages and posts you should find a “Smart App Banner” settings box. If you want the Smart App Banner to appear on this page then enter the App ID of your application here.

If you want to display a banner on the home page there’s a setting screen (Settings -&gt; Smart App Banner) where you can enter the App ID.

You can find the App ID in iTunes Connect or if the iTunes URL for your app looks like this:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rootn-tootn-baby-feed-timer/id<mark class="has-inline-color has-green-color" style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">***530589336***</mark>?ls=1&amp;mt=8

Then your ID is the bit I’ve highlighted.

You can download the plugin from the [WordPress Plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-app-banner/) or from inside WordPress by searching for “Smart App Banner.”
