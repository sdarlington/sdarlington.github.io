This weeks [PhotoFriday ](http://www.photofriday.com/ "PhotoFriday")theme is [Relaxation](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000662.php "PhotoFriday: Relaxation"). You can’t get much more relaxed than this market trader in Hue, [Vietnam](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/vietnam-2005.html "Vietnam photographs"). The eagle-eyed may note that I’ve [used this image](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/fresh.html "Fresh") for PhotoFriday before. What can I say? It amuses me!
