This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Wet](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000690.php "PhotoFriday: Wet").” Here is my entry.

This image was taken in My Son, [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html "Vietnam images and commentery"). It is an amazing sight, kind of like Ankor Wat but on a much smaller scale. What we didn’t have was the weather. I got drenched and my camera seized up shortly after I took this picture.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Loud](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=688 "PhotoFriday: Loud")“. I’m entry 193.
