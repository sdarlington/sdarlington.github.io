I should have believed the reviews. [This is not a good book](https://amzn.to/2pL3TQo). A few light sniggers and that’s about all.

The conceit is that Tony Hawks, writer and comedian, gets fan mail for Tony Hawk, celebrity skateboarder. He writes back.

I’ve loved many of Hawks past books but, despite only paying 99p for this one, I still feel like I overpaid for it.
