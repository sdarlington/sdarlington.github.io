I know I say this every week, but I had difficulty picking my image for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[The Coast](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000979.php).” And that’s because my first reaction was, well, any picture with the sea or ocean in it. Then I realised that “The Coast” is a little more specific than that; it may be where the water meets land but, to my mind at least, it doesn’t conjure images of a beach. Hence this picture take towards the end of my week in [Corsica, in Porto](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/corsica-evisa-to-porto.html).
