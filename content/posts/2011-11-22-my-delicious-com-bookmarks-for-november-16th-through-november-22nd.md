- [Coders are creatives too: Where’s our love?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/22/frank_fisher_creative_class/) – "How did a person whose greatest educational achievement is crayoning without going over the lines get termed 'a creative', when the people who built our world are dismissed as geeks and bottom feeders?"
- [Happy 40th birthday, Intel 4004!](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/15/the_first_forty_years_of_intel_microprocessors/) – In a way this stated the whole microcomputer… I hate to say "revolution" but I can't think of a better word.
- [Steve Jobs: The parable of the stones](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/11/11/steve-jobs-the-parable-of-the-stones/) – "It's the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work.

And the problem with that is that there's just a tremendous amount of craftsmanship in between a great idea and a great product."
