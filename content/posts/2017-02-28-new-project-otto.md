My wife got me a 3D printer for my birthday/Christmas. I’ve printed a few little things since then, but I’ve been itching for a bit of a project. I didn’t want anything *too* ambitious but, clearly, there’s no point in doing something that can’t fail.

After much searching, I decided upon [Otto](http://www.instructables.com/id/Otto-Build-You-Own-Robot-in-Two-Hours/), a walking, dancing, obstacle avoiding robot.

In this post I’ll talk about how I prepared for the project and my thoughts on its likely success (or otherwise).

The 3D print is *bigger* than anything I’ve done before but not necessarily any more complex.

The part of the project that I have the least experience with is the electronics. I’ve never really been a “hardware” person, though I built a 68000-based computer while at university. Fortunately Otto uses an off-the-shelf embedded computer called an Arduino so my terrible soldering skills won’t be tested.

What *is* complex for someone that doesn’t live and breath it, is the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) ecosystem. There are a number of different boards (varying both in size and features) *and* it’s open source so there are quite a few compatible variants available too. I picked a cheap compatible version. I do wonder if this will cause problems further down the line.

The “nano” has few built-in ports, so you need an I/O “shield” that plugs into the Arduino’s pins. That was nearly as expensive as the actual computer!

Finding small volumes of the other components proved a little tricky. Once you factor in delivery, it became almost as cheap to order ten servo motors rather than the four that I really needed. I’m sure I’ll find something to do with the others!

Anyway, I ordered all the bits and pieces that I *think* I need. It’s entirely possible that some of them are wrong. We’ll see.

Stay tuned for what happens when the components arrive.
