[![Looking over Hoan Kiem Lake, Hanoi, Vietnam](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/10817570864_d16b513163.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817570864/ "Looking over Hoan Kiem Lake, Hanoi, Vietnam by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Here is my rather delayed entry for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Relationship](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000807.php).” It’s the second picture I took in [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html), a couple overlooking the lake at the centre of Hanoi. Any resemblance to [this entry least year](/photography/photofriday/two.html) is entirely coincidental.
