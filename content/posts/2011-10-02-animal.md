[![Snow Monkey in Kamikochi](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5094350498_dbf55f9f40.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5094350498/ "Snow Monkey in Kamikochi by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Animal](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001123.php).” This animal was fast moving hence the slight blur but it was amazing to see this little fellah at such a short range. This was in [Kamikochi](/travel/japan-kamikochi.html), Japan. (I really wanted to include a picture from the Muppets but, for obvious reasons, I prefer to use one of my own images…)

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/inside.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Inside](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1121).” I’m entry number 186.
