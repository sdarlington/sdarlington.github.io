[![Rally of Corsica](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/11995894005_b542878dfa.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11995894005/ "Rally of Corsica by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I found this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Movement](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000781.php),” much easier than some of the [recent](/photography/photofriday/fire.html) [ones](/photography/photofriday/professional.html). As soon as I saw the title I knew that I had to use this image of a speeding rally car that I took last year in [Corsica](/travel/corsica.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Tools](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=779).” I’m entry 150.
