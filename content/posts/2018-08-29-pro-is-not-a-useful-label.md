Here is goes again. Apple announces new [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro/ "MacBook Pro")s (or there are rumours about a new [Mac mini pro](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/275763-apple-reportedly-plans-lower-cost-macbook-mac-mini-pro)) and the hoards pile on it saying it’s not a “Pro” machine. But what does that actually mean?

Traditionally the label “pro” is short for professional and is used to describe people who make their living using the tool. Sadly that definition is so ridiculously broad that it’s not terribly useful. What does a video editor, a writer, a 3D modeller and a software developer have in common?

Nothing.

Some need a fast CPU, others lots of memory, or storage or ports or GPU. Others just like the “best.”

And *that’s* the problem. We have to stop fixating on it being short for “professional.” It’s a marketing term, nothing more. It doesn’t *mean* anything beyond “expensive.” Just because it’s missing a feature that you’ve grown accustomed to does not mean that it’s not usable by professionals. *Maybe* it makes it unusable by *you* but that’s not the same thing at all.

If you work on a computer, buy the one the best meets your current and anticipated future needs. Whether that’s a MacBook or a Mac Pro, a Mac mini or an iMac Pro, even a Windows PC, the *name* doesn’t matter.

And if none of the computers in Apple’s current line up meet your requirements, that might legitimately be a problem. But, it’s not a new problem — Apple has had a relatively limited range since at least the late 90’s — and that still has nothing to do with the name.
