This is incredible. And I don’t use the word lightly.

The site in question is the [CAP Entertainment Media Analysis Reports](http://capalert.com/capreports/). Here you can find hundreds of “reviews” of movies and ratings of how well they conform to one interpretation of good Christian values. They claim that it’s objective but there are a number of opinions about the faith that would not be shared by all.

I think pretty much all of my favourite films do very badly on their scale. I have not checked through all of them yet but two of the best ones so far are for [The Incredibles](http://capalert.com/capreports/incredibles_the.htm) and [The Passion of the Christ](http://capalert.com/capreports/passionofthechrist.htm). They both score roughly the same, yet the former, a typical [Pixar](http://www.pixar.com/) movie with all those hallmarks that Disney films used to have, has “…behavioral, moral and value implantation dangers” while the latter, despite depicting a man being nailed to a cross, “…is \[only\] a movie.”
