You’d think that living the UK I’d have no trouble whatsoever with the PhotoFriday theme “[Overcast](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000971.php).”Except, with so much choice, well, which do you choose?

Ultimately I thought this image from our [Christmas in Iceland](/travel/iceland.html) fitted the bill rather better than anything I could find from the UK.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/blurred.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Blurred](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=969).” I’m entry number 263.
