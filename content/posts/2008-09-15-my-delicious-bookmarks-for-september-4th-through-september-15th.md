- [Has the Large Hadron Collider destroyed the earth yet?](http://www.hasthelhcdestroyedtheearth.com/) – Very handy.
- [Bill Gates &amp; Jerry Seinfeld – Shoe Circus Commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afR5J7eskno) – This Vista video is a lot like Vista itself. Microsoft clearly spent a lot of money on it but there's no real point to it.
- [How Anti-Intellectualism Is Destroying America](http://www.alternet.org/story/95109/) – "No country in the West democratized education earlier, but no country has been more suspicious of too much education. We've always thought of education as good if it gets you a better job, but bad if it makes you think too much." This article is about the US but it's not dramatically different here.
