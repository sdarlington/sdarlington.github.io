[![Camel ride, Wadi Rum, Jordan](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/10817597274_61cc5a9329.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817597274/ "Camel ride, Wadi Rum, Jordan by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I flipped through lots of images for this weeks PhotoFriday theme,  
“[Slowly](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000946.php),” but I thought that this image fitted the bill and was a little different from most of the photos already posted. It’s of a line of camels *slowly* plodding towards our camp in [Wadi Rum](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/jordan-wadi-rum.html), [Jordan](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/jordan-petra.html).

I didn’t post an entry for last weeks PhotoFriday. (Indeed I was so busy that I didn’t even vote for my own entry in the challenge the previous week! No wonder I didn’t win.)
