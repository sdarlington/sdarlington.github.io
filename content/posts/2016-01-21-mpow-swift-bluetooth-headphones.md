Buying the [Mpow Swift Bluetooth Headphones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00OK5BELU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00OK5BELU&linkCode=as2&tag=zx81orguk)![](http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zx81orguk&l=as2&o=2&a=B00OK5BELU) was an experiment to see if there was a solution to a very first world problem: tangled headphone cables.

*Good* bluetooth headphones easily go into the hundreds of pounds. These were less than £20 and, considering that, are surprisingly good.

They’re in-ear and block enough sound that I can listen to podcasts on the tube which is my main requirement. The sound quality is fine for music if you’re not too picky.

My main gripes are the colour (bright green) and the battery indicator which drops from a claimed 30% full to zero in milliseconds. In practice I don’t let it drop much below 50% before re-charging.

Overall it’s difficult to argue for the price.
