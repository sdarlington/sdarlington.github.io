This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Busy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000682.php "PhotoFriday: Busy").” Here is my entry.

This image was taken as the sun rose over Adams Peak in [Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html "Sri Lanka pictures"), after our night climb to the top. Despite the unsociable hour, it was incredibly *busy*. Some of the older folk were very competitive, pushing us out of the way for a prime spot to see the sun-rise.
