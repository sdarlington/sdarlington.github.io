When I got my new MacBook it wasn’t complete. I sat it down on my desk and nothing would connect.

I tried to plug in my monitor, but I needed a dongle to connect to my DVI monitor. My FireWire external hard-drive needed an adapter. I had to get a card reader as my camera takes CompactFlash cards. Even my USB hub needed replacing because my new computer came with a newer, faster USB standard.

This wasn’t last week and this wasn’t a [2016 MacBook Pro](http://mashable.com/2016/10/28/macbook-pro-dongle-hell/#R2vGHVkO3Sqo). This was in 2011 when I replaced by Core2 Duo MacBook with a [MacBook Pro 15″](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP620?locale=en_GB). Different monitor port. FireWire 800 rather than FireWire 400. The USB ports upgraded to USB 2.

This is why I am mystified that, a week after Apple’s event, people are *still* complaining that they might have to buy some dongles when they upgrade. I have to buy a few adapters *every time I buy a new computer*.

Am I saying that I love to carry round a bag of adapters (and lose them)? No, of course not. But I *do* love carrying around a computer that doesn’t have all the legacy crap that most Windows laptops still have. A colleague got a new laptop last month and it had a VGA port ([first launched in 1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array)) that he’ll almost certainly never use!

In a short time we’ll have Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C peripherals and everything will be much better. This is the price we pay for being trailblazers but I, for one, think it’s worth it.
