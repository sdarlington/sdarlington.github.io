I’m afraid that I didn’t have any pictures of vampires for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Twilight](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1369).” I had to make do with this image, taken on my iPhone from my back garden. (In fact I do have a couple of other pictures that might match the theme better, but I’ve already used them for PhotoFriday before. I decided to use a new picture instead.)

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/female.html "Female") in last weeks challenge, “[Female](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1367).” I’m entry number 39.
