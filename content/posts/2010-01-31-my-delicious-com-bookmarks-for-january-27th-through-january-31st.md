- [Who Can Do Something About Those Blue Boxes?](http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/blue_boxes) – "Used to be you could argue that Flash, whatever its merits, delivered content to the entire audience you cared about. That’s no longer true, and Adobe’s Flash penetration is shrinking with each iPhone OS device Apple sells."
- [Penguins, Peaks and Penny-Farthings: Nat Geo Covers 1959-2000](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/01/national-geographic-covers-gallery/all/1) – "The National Geographic Society celebrates its 122nd anniversary on Jan. 27 … Though the early issues had rather drab academic looking covers, by 1959 they were consistently adorned with eye-cathing art and photos."
