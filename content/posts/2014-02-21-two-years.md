What a difference two years makes. Just a little over twenty-four months ago we were awaiting the arrival of our son. To commemorate the occasion we went to the park and took a few pictures. The bump, after all, would be short lived.

Since then we’ve spent a lot of time in the playground where these pictures were taken.

Last week we did the same thing, now that we’re expecting our daughter in a few weeks. Other than the obvious difference — we had a two year old in tow this time — we had a very different time of year and a change of location — [Cannizaro House](http://www.cannizarohouse.com).

With six weeks to go, the bump is quite possibly as big as it was at the *end* of the last pregnancy. This is unfortunate as last time there was no need to run after a very energetic toddler…

Make that an energetic, wilful and opinionated toddler. This picture is after chasing him around a flower garden for five minutes!

Still, he stays still for a while when something piques his interest. And, in this respect, you can’t get better than a really good stick.

With him suitably distracted, we managed to take a few more pictures. It was a nice, bright February day. The light was great.

And we had a lot of fun taking them. Hopefully it will be good to look back at them in a few years time.
