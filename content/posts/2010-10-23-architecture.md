My first ideas when I first heard that this weeks PhotoFriday theme was “[Architecture](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001026.php)” was [New York](/travel/new-new-york.html). I flirted with other places and ideas — such as the Eiffel Tower and a couple of shots from Vienna — but I kept coming back to the sky-scrapers and bridges of Manhattan. In the end I picked this one because it has Brooklyn Bridge *and* the Empire State Building.

No need to feel guilty for not voting for my entry last week as I skipped the last couple of challenges.
