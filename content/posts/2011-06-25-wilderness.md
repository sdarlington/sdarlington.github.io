[![Yosemite from Olmsted Point (B&W)](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4871719607_3e2c26ff1f.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4871719607/ "Yosemite from Olmsted Point (B&W) by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I’ve a feeling that I’ve used this picture for at least one PhotoFriday before, but I can’t think of a better image that I’ve taken that says “[Wilderness](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001095.php)” any better. It was taken in [Yosemite](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/yosemite.html) from Olmsted Point.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/building.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Building](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1093).” I’m entry number 226.
