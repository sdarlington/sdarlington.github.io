I’ve not been quite so active blogging this year due to a number of factors. A case in point: it wasn’t until December that I wrote about my holiday in July and a friends wedding in August!

This meant that the most popular articles were actually written in previous years:

1. [Sophia Smith](/photography/sophia-smith.html)
2. [Eight Best Computer Books](/computing/opinion/eight-best-computer-books.html)
3. [Installing Oracle 10g on CentOS4](/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/installing-oracle-10g-express-edition-on-centos-4.html)
4. [Minolta Dual Scan II](/computing/opinion/dualscanii.html)
5. [iPhone Dev: Saving State](/computing/software/iphone-dev-saving-state.html)

While I appreciate people visiting, I am continually surprised by the appeal of some of these. Oracle 10g and CentOS 4 are, in software terms, ancient! And the Dual Scan II is more than a decade old — I bought it with my iBook G3 in 2001!

The most read articles that were written this year were:

1. [iOS Developer Program: from individual to company](/computing/opinion/ios-developer-program-from-individual-to-company.html)
2. [Do Apple take 40% in the EU?](/computing/opinion/do-apple-take-40-in-the-eu.html)
3. [Programming is Hard](/computing/opinion/programming-is-hard.html)
4. [Why you need a crash reporter](/computing/opinion/why-you-need-a-crash-reporter.html)

Kind of surprising that they were all about iOS development.

And here are a few blogs that I liked writing but, it turns out, people didn’t enjoy reading…

- [Dear Companies House.](/blog/dear-companies-house.html) A cathartic rant elicited a response from the target
- [Programming is Hard](/computing/opinion/programming-is-hard.html)
- [Your most important customers](/computing/opinion/your-most-important-customers.html)
- [The Trouble with eBooks](/computing/opinion/the-trouble-with-ebooks.html)
- [A new CEO for Yahoo?](/computing/opinion/a-new-ceo-for-yahoo.html)
