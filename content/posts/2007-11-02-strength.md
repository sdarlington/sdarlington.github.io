This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Strength](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000716.php "PhotoFriday: Strength").” Here is my entry.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Silence](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=714 "PhotoFriday: Silence").” I am entry number 300.
