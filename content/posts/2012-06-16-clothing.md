This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Clothing](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001196.php).”I had a few options for this one — including a few people dressed in outrageous clothes at the “Protest the Pope” rally in London — but in the end I went for this picture of drying clothes in [Havana, Cuba](/travel/cuba.html "Cuba, 2004").

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/geometric.html "Geometric") in last weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Geometric](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1194).” I’m entry number 142.
