I know I’m bucking a trend here by posting this on a Friday, but here is my entry for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Wheels](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000973.php).” Okay, this car has never been *my* set of wheels, but this is a really neat car that’s in amazing condition considering its age. Before I went to [Cuba](/travel/cuba.html) I assumed that cars like this were only visible on postcards. I quickly found that they’re all over the place. They’re also far less glamorous and practical when you get inside. Great fun though.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/overcast.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Overcast](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=971).” I’m entry number 259. (I’m also rather annoyed with Iceland since the volcano eruption there caused me to cancel my holiday this week!)
