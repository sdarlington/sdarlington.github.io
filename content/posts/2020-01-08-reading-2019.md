I failed.

By half a book! I missed my goal of twelve books in 2019 by a few hundred pages[^1].

In my defence, “[Guns, Germs and Steel](/blog/guns-germs-and-steel.html)[^aff]” is very long but the *real* culprit ([like the previous year](/blog/reading-2018.html)) is my lack of a commute. Not that I’m sick of working from home yet but that was my reading time and now I just don’t have a time that I consistently set aside.

Still, [eleven books isn’t bad](/tag/reading2019) when you consider all the other material I was reading too. (Might be better for my mental health if I dial it down on Brexit news!) In 2019 there was a better mix of fiction and non-fiction, too, so, while I didn’t reach my target, it worked out pretty well anyway.

I’ve set the same target of twelve books for 2020. Let’s see how that goes.

[^1]: Depending on how you count them. I read a few technical books (“[Scala Cookbook](https://amzn.to/2FlRqXn)[^aff],” “[Deploying to OpenShift](https://amzn.to/2FknJpH)“[^aff]) among others but somewhat arbitrarily I’ve not included those in the tally.
