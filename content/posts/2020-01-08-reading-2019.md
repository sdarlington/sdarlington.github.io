<span style="color: var(--color-text); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400">I failed.</span>

By half a book! I missed my goal of twelve books in 2019 by a few hundred pages<sup>[1](#fn1-31549 "see footnote")</sup>.

In my defence, “[Guns, Germs and Steel](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/guns-germs-and-steel.html)” is very long but the *real* culprit ([like the previous year](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/reading-2018.html)) is my lack of a commute. Not that I’m sick of working from home yet but that was my reading time and now I just don’t have a time that I consistently set aside.

Still, [eleven books isn’t bad](https://www.zx81.org.uk/tag/reading2019) when you consider all the other material I was reading too. (Might be better for my mental health if I dial it down on Brexit news!) In 2019 there was a better mix of fiction and non-fiction, too, so, while I didn’t reach my target, it worked out pretty well anyway.

I’ve set the same target of twelve books for 2020. Let’s see how that goes.

1. Depending on how you count them. I read a few technical books (“[Scala Cookbook](https://amzn.to/2FlRqXn),” “[Deploying to OpenShift](https://amzn.to/2FknJpH)“) among others but somewhat arbitrarily I’ve not included those in the tally. [↩︎](#fnr1-31549 "return to article")
