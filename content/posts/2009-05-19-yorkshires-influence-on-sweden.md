!["Ej Upp" sign, Stockholm underground](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img_0155.jpg?resize=500%2C375 ""Ej Upp" sign, Stockholm underground")

I was confused by these signs. Surely “Ej upp” is a greeting? And if so, why is it in red with a “no entry” icon?

At the risk of detracting from what it supposed to be humour, some northern English dialect is actually [descended from Scandinavia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/voices2005/glossary/dialects.shtml). Though whenever I see most of these comparison charts I don’t recognise half the words!
