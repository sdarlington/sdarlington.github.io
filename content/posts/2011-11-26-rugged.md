[![The truck that takes us back to civilisation, Cuba](https://i0.wp.com/farm7.staticflickr.com/6042/6406047317_628ba4ce1b.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/6406047317/ "The truck that takes us back to civilisation, Cuba by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I wanted something big and chunky for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Rugged](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001139.php),” and the best thing that I could think of was the truck that we took from the countryside in [Cuba](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cuba.html) back to some semblance of civilisation.

I’ve not entered the last few weeks of PhotoFriday challenges, so there’s no need for you to vote for last weeks photo.
