While perhaps better suited for the category “minimal” I am using it for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Minimalism](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000777.php).” It was taken (very recently) in Santa Croce, Florence, Italy.

I would normally link to the trip that the picture came from, but I’ve not written that post yet! Instead feel free to look at the images from my [last trip to Tuscany](/travel/italy2.html).
