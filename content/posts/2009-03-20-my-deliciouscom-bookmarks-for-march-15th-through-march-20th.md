- [Coming to an ID Card Near You: Your DNA](http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=2013&blogid=14) – "Can there be any doubt that the UK government will, at some point, try to add DNA to the other biometrics on the card?" Scary stuff.
- [How to spot a hidden religious agenda](https://www.sott.net/articles/show/177635-How-to-spot-a-hidden-religious-agenda) – Apparently this article was pulled from the New Scientist website shortly after it was published which is a bid odd as there's nothing scientifically objectionable.
- [Tea really does taste better from your favourite cup](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4981229/Tea-really-does-taste-better-from-your-favourite-cup.html) – "Your daily brew tastes better from your favourite mug."
