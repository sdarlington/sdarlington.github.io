This links in with my earlier post about good technology being invisible. Fonts and typefaces have a far bigger impact on the readability of text than most people think yet you almost never notice their design unless it’s bad enough to make it difficult to comprehend.

This blog, “[Quality in Typefaces &amp; Fonts](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2005/12/quality_in_type.html),” by Thomas Phinney, an Adobe employee, doesn’t discuss the *design* of typefaces — which is an interesting area in itself — but does give some insight into how much effort goes into making a good electronic font.
