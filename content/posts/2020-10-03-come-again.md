I learned about this book on [Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast](https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/rhlstp_281_robert_webb/) (RHLSTP!). One of my favourite nineties comedy performers interviewing one of my favourite two-thousands comedy performers. I guess what I’m saying is that I’m not entirely impartial; I was predisposed to like “[Come Again](https://amzn.to/36vdoWW).”

Webb’s [first book was a kind of a memoir](/blog/how-not-to-be-a-boy.html). This is a novel. I’m pretty much the perfect demographic. The lead character went to an English university in the early nineties to study Computer Science. Even though it was a different university, so much was familiar.

Is it well written and researched or just lazy nostalgia?

I think that’s *the* question for the book as a whole. It’s a quick, unchallenging read. The writing is functional and it’s structured to included a few nice twists and the odd end-of-chapter cliff hanger.

The three sections are quite different in tone. The first and second work well but the third, while entertaining, doesn’t quite seem to fit.

So clearly I’m not going to describe this as “must read.” It’s a fun read and maybe that’s all it needs to be.
