Sometimes a quote from [the article](http://www.hcnonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17270600&BRD=1574&PAG=461&dept_id=532215&rfi=6 "Houston Community Newspapers Online - Parent criticizes book 'Fahrenheit 451'") can say more than I ever could:

> Alton Verm’s request to ban “Fahrenheit 451” came during the 25th annual Banned Books Week. He and Hines said the request to ban “Fahrenheit 451,” a book about book burning, during Banned Books Weeks is a coincidence.

I think they should look up the word “irony” in a dictionary.
