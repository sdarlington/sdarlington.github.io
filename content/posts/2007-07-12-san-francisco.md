\[photopress:IMG\_3382.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]In April last year I had never visited the west coast of America, so it’s slightly odd to think that this was my third trip there this year — first to [Berkeley](/travel/berkeley-point-lobos-and-carmel.html "Berkeley") and [Monterey](/travel/monterey-bay-aquarium.html "Monterey Bay Aquarium"), and last month to Marin for work. This time I increased by “bridge count,” visited The City (as locals call [San Francisco](/travel/california-2006.html "My first trip to the Bay Area")), [Marin](/travel/muir-woods.html "Muir Woods are in Marin County") (the county north of the Golden Gate Bridge), and two universities ([Berkeley](/blog/longer-days-means.html "A sign in Berkeley") and [Stanford](/photography/egg-head.html "Palo Alto")).

From there I saw the Transamerica Pyramid in the distance and decided to wander over for a closer look. As I got closer I lost it a couple of times but I persevered and you can see a shot from the base here. At ground level there was a lot of building work. Don’t know what they were doing but it wasn’t pretty.

In the Friday evening we took a tour out to [Alcatraz](/travel/alcatraz.html "Alcatraz tour"). By the time we were heading back it was sunset and this allowed some beautiful pictures of San Fransisco itself lit by the golden, fading sun.

Heading back to the UK and seeing all the [flooding in the news](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/6240038.stm "Flooding in the UK") it’s sad to think that it’s going to be a while before we head back to the Bay Area again.
