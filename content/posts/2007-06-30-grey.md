This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Gray](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000680.php "PhotoFriday: Gray"). Here is my entry.

My thesaurus tells me that a synonym for grey, in the sense of grey day, is gloomy and sunless. You canâ€™t get much more gloomy and sunless than this day at Geysir in [Iceland](/travel/iceland.html "Iceland Pictures and commentary")!
