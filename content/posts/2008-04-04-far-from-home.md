When you first step foot abroad everything seems fascinating and new. After a while you manage to acclimatise to most of the sights, sounds and smells, yet occasionally something still makes you feel “[Far from home](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000760.php).” (Which is this weeks PhotoFriday theme.) In this case, a seemingly normal sign on a [beach in Egypt](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html) stands out when you note that camels are banned from enjoying the surf.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Emotions](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=758).” I’m entry 100.
