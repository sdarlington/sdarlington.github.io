It’s a cliche to ask where the year has gone but it’s no less true this year than any other. Life has got in the way of blogging more than usual — moving house, a toddler, work — with only 23 posts this year and only one of those making my “most read” list.

Talking of which, these are the most read blogs this year:

1. [iOS Developer Program: from individual to company](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/ios-developer-program-from-individual-to-company.html "iOS Developer Program: from individual to company")
2. [iPhone Dev: Saving State](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/software/iphone-dev-saving-state.html "iPhone Dev: Saving State")
3. [Do Apple take 40% in the EU?](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/do-apple-take-40-in-the-eu.html "Do Apple take 40% in the EU?")
4. [AQGridView to UICollectionView](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/aqgridview-to-uicollectionview.html "AQGridView to UICollectionView")
5. [Old Fashioned](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/old-fashioned.html "Old Fashioned")

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Probably my favourite blog of the year was “</span>[What to do?](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/what-to-do.html "What to do?")<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">” but I posted it a little too late to get the readership that I would have liked.</span>

I’m surprised that it’s my more technical posts that have had the greatest readership as, in general, I don’t write very many of them. Maybe I should look to do more of that next year? But with a toddler running around and another baby on the way I largely suspect that 2014, on the blogging front, will look a lot like this year.
