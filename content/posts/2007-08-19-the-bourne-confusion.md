Have you seen The ‘[The Bourne Ultimatum](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/ "IMDB talks about Bourne Ultimatum")‘ yet? What do you think when you see the title? Tragically my mind immediately jumps to the [Bourne Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell "Bourne Shell"), the default command shell on most Unix variants since the late seventies ((A quick aside for the less technical readers. A “shell” is the kind of the file manager you use to interact with your computer. The Macintosh has the Finder; Windows has the Explorer; the Linux has the “Bourne Again Shell,” bad pun and derivation and enhancement of the original Bourne version.)).

Of course this isn’t the first time that this has happened. When I saw the title ‘[The Bourne Supremacy](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/ "IMDB on Bourne Supremacy")‘ I though, “Yeah, why would anyone use the C Shell?!” Clearly Bourne and its work-a-likes are supreme for scripting even if the original [Joy](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html "Interesting piece by Bill Joy")-authored C Shell was better for interactive tasks.

Similarly, in [the first movie](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/ "IMDB on the Bourne Identity") the focus seemed to be on this guy *Jason* Bourne. I was thinking, “No, you’re thinking of *Stephen* Bourne.” And it’s AT&amp;T Bell Labs, not the CIA.

I really shouldn’t let this kind of thing get in the way of a good film, but it’s not like us Unix guys really get much of a choice. So I’m going to end this piece with a plea: don’t end up like me. Don’t let your choice of computing platform get in the way of your movie viewing.
