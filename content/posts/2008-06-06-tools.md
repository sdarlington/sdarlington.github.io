I’m not entirely sure what this is — a spinning wheel thingy used in some form of textiles — but it’s certainly a tool and, therefore, not a bad candidate for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge. It was taken in [San Carlos Borroméo de Carmelo Mission](http://www.carmelmission.org/), [California](/travel/berkeley-point-lobos-and-carmel.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Minimalism](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=777).” I am entry number 231.
