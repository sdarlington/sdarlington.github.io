[![What to see next in the Lindos acropolis](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5632213263_550ee1749f.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5632213263/ "What to see next in the Lindos acropolis by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Apparently I’m “famous” for *not* taking pictures of people, which should have made [this weeks PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001089.php) challenge especially tricky for me. However, in practice I decided on this image pretty quickly. It was taken in [Lindos](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lindos-and-rhodes-east-coast-greece.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/sundown.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Sundown](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1087).” I’m number 160.
