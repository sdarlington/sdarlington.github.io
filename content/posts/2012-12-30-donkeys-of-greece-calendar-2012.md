Is wasn’t really my idea. I saw it in the newsagents in [Rhodes Town](/travel/rhodes-town-greece.html) and laughed but I never really thought of actually buying it. The credit for that goes to [my wife](http://www.brandarling.com/).

I’ve been posting pictures of each month entry on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sdarlington) and Facebook but I thought it would be nice to group them all together in one post. That’s what you’ll find here.
