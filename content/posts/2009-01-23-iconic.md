[![First view of the Treasury, Petra, Jordan](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/10817478306_892444d787.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817478306/ "First view of the Treasury, Petra, Jordan by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

[Petra and its Treasury](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/jordan-petra.html) are justly considered travel icons, which, I think, makes it a great candidate for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Icon](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000844.php).” Shots like this are used almost everywhere Petra is mentioned (the other is the Treasury with a camel sat in front of it), which kind of makes it an iconic — in the sense of having a conventional formulaic style — photo, too.

Also, please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Meditation](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=842).” I’m entry number 211.
