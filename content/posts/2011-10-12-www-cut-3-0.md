I’m very pleased to announce the new version of www.cut, a major release including an almost complete rewrite of all the UI code and a bunch of stuff under the hood. You don’t care about that, but it does bring you iPad support, the ability to lengthen already shortened URLs and the ability to sync your settings between devices using iCloud.

The iCloud bit, as with lots of stuff under the hood, means that it will only work on devices that run iOS5.

On the “business” side, www.cut is no longer free. It is now a “tier one” app, that means 99 cents, 69 pence or your local equivalent.

The reason for this change is two-fold: advertising, despite what you may have heard, is not a massive money-spinner unless you have millions of users. www.cut, you won’t be surprised to hear, has nowhere near that. Secondly, and more importantly in some ways, I just don’t like adverts. I almost always pay for apps in preference to using an ad supported version. I think the app is better without them.

With the change, I have tried to be as fair as I can. All existing users will get the upgrade for free, including those who only have the free version. I thought it better to be generous to early adopters that screw over the people who actually upgraded.
