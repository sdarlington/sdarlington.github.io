It’s been a while since I entered PhotoFriday, but, for something I did quickly on my iPhone, I really like this image. And it’s one that works well in [Black and White](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1413), which happens to be this week theme. It’s the charred remains of a building that burned down not far from home.
