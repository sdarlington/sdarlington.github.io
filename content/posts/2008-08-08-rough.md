This broken branch from a tree in [Muir Woods](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/muir-woods.html), [California](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/california-2006.html) looks pretty [Rough](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000797.php) to me, hence I’m using as this weeks PhotoFriday challenge.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Beauty](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=795).” I am entry number 261.
