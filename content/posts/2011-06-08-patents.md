The cartoon ((Sorry it’s too big. I couldn’t find a way to shrink it without stealing a copy.)) for today’s [Dilbert Day to Day Desk Calendar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003ZG50NI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zx81orguk&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B003ZG50NI)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=2&a=B003ZG50NI) seemed appropriate for some things that are happening in the mobile software industry at the moment.

If you’ve not been following events — shame on you — then you can read all about it [here](http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/05/lodsys-sues-7-app-developers-in-eastern.html). In summary, a number of small developers have been sued by a “patent troll,” that is a company that does not develop or make anything but demands royalties for the use of “intellectual property” it bought.

These events and the cartoon show quite succinctly everything that is wrong with the current patent system.
