Most readers will be aware that here in London we’re experiencing the worst winter for many years. We woke up this morning with a layer of snow that went past my ankle, which, sure, isn’t going to get any [Norwegians worrying](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7865001.stm) but is quite dramatic by SW19 standards.

Unlike many people, I actually made it into the office but, rather than get stranded there, I came home at lunch time and took a few pictures before sitting back in front of my laptop.

It’s good to get out and about with my camera again; it’s been too long. But hopefully next time it will be a little warmer and I’ll be able to breathe out without fogging up the lens.
