Eric Schmidt says [Google is the new Microsoft and it’s winning the war against Apple](http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3758790/google-eric-schmidt-android-winning-war "http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/12/3758790/google-eric-schmidt-android-winning-war"). I think he’s missing some perspective.

One of the key things that Steve Jobs realised when he returned to Apple in the late nineties was that the industry is not necessarily a zero sum game.

> “[We have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of the notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose.](http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html "http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html")”

The current situation is not identical but I think that the lessons might be substantially the same. While Google believe that they’re winning it’s not clear to me that they’re playing the same game as Apple and Microsoft. It’s like saying that you’re winning at Scrabble when your opponent is playing Chess; sure, you played some great words on triple letter scores, but your chances of getting check-mate are limited.

For all Google’s efforts and marketshare, most web traffic and ad impressions — the real metric that they’re interested in — still comes from iOS. They largely succeeded in commoditising the smartphone, unfortunately their users either don’t surf the web much or, in the case of Android-derived devices like the Kindle Fire, do but don’t go via Google.

Would they not be better toning down the rhetoric and figuring out how everyone can play nicely? War makes for good headlines but often ends in everyone losing.

For Google to win, Apple does not have to lose.
