[![Reflection of my office](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8312/7950806104_a0301af46b.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/7950806104/ "Reflection of my office by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I think like many photographers I love “[Reflections](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001225.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday challenge theme, and have many images that feature them. However, I wanted to use a picture that I’ve not already used for a challenge and that pushed me towards this picture [I took from my office window](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/london-bridge.html "London Bridge") a few weeks ago: a Union Jack reflected in a window.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/texture.html "Texture") in last weeks challenge, “[Texture](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1223).” I’m entry number 130.
