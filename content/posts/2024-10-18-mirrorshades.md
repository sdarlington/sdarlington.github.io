*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

I’m surprised this didn’t get more of a response when I posted it on Mastodon, to be honest. A while ago I was talking about sci-fi books with a colleague. He was amazed I had a copy and practically begged to borrow it. (Unlike Peopleware, I did get it back!)

It is the *definitive* collection of cyberpunk short-stories. Much of what I wrote about [Neuromancer](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/neuromancer.html) could be written about [Mirrorshades](https://amzn.to/402CDLT) \[affiliate link\], so I won’t repeat myself.
