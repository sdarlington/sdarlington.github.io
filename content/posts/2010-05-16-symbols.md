We see symbols pretty much everywhere, both graphic symbols and metaphorical ones. Lots of other entries to [this weeks PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000981.php) went for the metaphorical option — indeed my first thoughts were crosses, minarets, the pyramids, stone henge — so I decided to head in the opposite direction with this instruction painted on the pavement of the [Brompton Cemetery](http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/brompton_cemetery/).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-coast.html) in last weeks challenge, “[The Coast](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=979).” I’m entry number 223.
