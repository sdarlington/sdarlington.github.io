I assure you: it’s not deliberate. I’d like to go on record and say that I do *not* plan to only go to obscure — some have even said dangerous — places. I just go where my interests lie.

I’ve been to a couple of Buddhist countries recently ([Thailand](/travel/thailand.html) and [Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html)), but they both practise the same kind of Buddhism — called Theravada. I originally thought that they were the less pure form, the Church of England to Tibet’s Catholicism. I went to Tibet to see the “real” Buddhism, however it turns out that, in some ways, the opposite is true (it’s a long story; leave comments!). Tibetan Buddhism (Mahayana) is actually a merger of the traditional Tibetan religion, B?n, with more normal Buddhism.

My confusion over their form of Buddhism was only the start of it. It’s a schizophrenic place, one where the peoples army destroyed some temples and preserved others, fighting between themselves on more than one occasion.

The Chinese have transformed Lhasa to such an extent that there’s now a “Tibetan Quarter,” yet the Tibetans still seem to be certain of their own identity.

It’s easy to see how people become passionate about the cause of the Tibetan people, however to deny that the Chinese have had a significant positive effect (in some ways) is undeniable.

So I’m in two minds about the place. Maybe with these pictures you’ll be able to make up your own mind. Let me know if you do!

The first few pictures here are all in Kathmandu; there are so few of them that it didn’t seem worth creating a new page for them.

If the pictures have piqued your interest, there are a few web Sites that you might want to visit:

- I’ve deliberately avoided talking about the politics of the area, but as a member of Amnesty it’s difficult not to feel involved to some extent. Have a look at the [Free Tibet Campaign](http://www.freetibet.org/) or the main [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org/) site if you want to read more.
- As always, there’s a Lonely Planet guide. You can buy a copy from Amazon ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864501626/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864501626/zx81orguk00)). However, I found the Footprint guide to be much better ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1900949334/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1900949334/zx81orguk00)).
- You might also like to read “Sorrow Mountain” by Ani Pachen, a Tibetan Nun. The language used is almost child-like in its simplicity, but, because of what she had to endure, it’s not an easy read. Worth the effort, though. (Available from Amazon [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553811959/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553811959/zx81orguk00).)
- [Tibetan Buddhism Timeline](http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/tib_timeline.htm). On the trip we saw many of the important sites mentioned in this list.
