If you read my thoughts on the first book in the Kestrel series, “[Changer](/blog/changer.html)” you’ll have a good idea of my thinking about [the second, “Toll”](https://amzn.to/2nUhDHs) [affiliate link].

It’s an entertaining, light read. I think that’s the intention, so I don’t mean that as a back-handed compliment.

Compared with last time, the MacGuffin didn’t bother me as much. What jarred were the constant info-dumps.

> “\[Barcelona is\] the sixth most populous urban area in the European Union. Within Spain, it is second only to Madrid. But globally, it does not appear in the first ninety.”

I didn’t choose to read Wikipedia! There are even discussions about climate change and Brexit, which I’m not sure is a good idea. The former, at least, is relevant to the story-line (if a bit preachy) but the latter stands only to date the book.

Anyway, none of that is really a big problem. After “[Guns, Germs and Steel](/blog/guns-germs-and-steel.html)” I needed something less strenuous and this totally hit the spot.
