“[Surfaces](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000953.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday theme, is kind of an odd subject, I mean in some sense almost everything is or has a surface. But what I liked about the [Getty Museum in Los Angeles](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/los-angeles.html) is that the whole building was strange shapes and *surfaces*, something that I tried to get across in this image. Which I thought made it a decent candidate for this weeks challenge.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/distant.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Distant](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=951).” I’m entry 189.
