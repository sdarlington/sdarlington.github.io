This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Disastrous](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000737.php).” Here is my entry.

I’m not sure whether it’s my imagination or my photo library that ran dry for this theme, but I couldn’t find a great image. Instead, find this more comedy picture. I’ve generally found Citi’s service to be disastrous.

This picture was taken in [San Francisco](/travel/san-francisco.html), [California](/blog/merchant-bankers.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Mountain](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=735).” I’m entry number 70.
