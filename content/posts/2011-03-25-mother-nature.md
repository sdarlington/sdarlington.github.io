This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Mother Nature](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001069.php).” I wanted to do something a little better than a pretty landscape or a beautiful landscape. Sure, they’re both *by* mother nature but I don’t think that’s all there is. I wanted to show the creation and the power and, to a certain extent, how little control we have over the whole process. [Iceland](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/iceland.html) is about as good as it gets for that kind of thing, with the volcanos and geysers. We didn’t see any volcanos when we were there — which would have fitted the theme even better — but this is an image at Geysir. It’s dark and miserable, even at 11.30, in December but it’s still spectacular.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Polished](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1067).” I’m entry number 144.
