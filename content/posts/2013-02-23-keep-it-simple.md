[![Simples](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8236/8500142969_2642e48497.jpg?resize=500%2C375)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/8500142969/ "Simples by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I stumbled across a weekly photo competition on Flickr called [FlickrFriday](http://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrfriday/) and thought I would enter *that* this week instead of PhotoFriday.

This weeks theme is “Keep it simple” and, as any British person will tell you, that means meerkats.

But please still consider voting for my entry in last weeks PhotoFriday, “[Neglected](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1264).” I’m entry number 123.
