If you came to look at ZX81.org.uk a couple of hours ago you may have noticed that it wasn’t here. I’m pleased to announce that we’re back, and better than ever.

The reason for this outage was an upgrade. I generally find it easier to stay with the current version of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress CMS") but with the big jump to 2.1 I chickened out. Until this evening.

And, honestly, it wasn’t too tricky. I did a test upgrade on my laptop using the webserver and MySQL database in [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/home.php "Macintosh, Apache, Mysql and PHP"). I found that the template I use needed a quick update (as detailed on [GFXedit](http://www.gfxedit.com/theme-fixes/fixes-for-wordpress-21-ella.html)) but otherwise the upgrade script seems to have done the job without any trouble. Please let me know if you do find anything wrong.

And the website vanishing? Entirely down to operator error I’m afraid. Need I mention the importance of [regular backups](/computing/opinion/backup.html "My backup regime")?

So overall, a great job by the WordPress team — thanks guys — and a rather shoddy job by my clumsy fingers!
