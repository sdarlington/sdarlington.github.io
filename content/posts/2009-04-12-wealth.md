A little late this week, but here is my entry for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Wealth](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000866.php).” I have to say that I don’t “get” a lot of the other entries to the challenge, but the connection between wealth and the [New York](/travel/new-york-2006.html) Stock Exchange should be pretty obvious, even though the link may not be quite as strong as it was a year ago!
