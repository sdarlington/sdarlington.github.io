“[Daybreak](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001014.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday, is a tricky challenge for me. I’m much more likely to be around at sun*set* than at day break. What can I say? I’m just not a morning person. But I will concede that getting up early, or at least not sleeping well, was worth it to see sunrise over the [Himalayas](/travel/tibet.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/round.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Round](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1012).” I’m entry number 229.
