This weeks PhotoFriday is “[Open](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001061.php)” so as I usually do, I opened Aperture and typed in the keyword. Aperture helpfully came up with… all my pictures from C*open*hagen. Sigh. So it took a but longer to find this picture of an open window in [Tuscany](/travel/colle-di-val-delsa-tuscany-italy.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/contrast-2.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Contrast](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1059).” I’m entry number 249.
