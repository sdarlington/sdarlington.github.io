<span style="color: var(--color-text); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">A few years ago we got an Amazon </span>[Fire](https://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/reviews/amazon-fire-7.html)<span style="color: var(--color-text); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"> tablet and I could almost copy and paste that review for </span>[the ninth generation unit](https://amzn.to/2ZMChrI)<span style="color: var(--color-text); font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">.</span>

My biggest complaint this time around is the battery life. It feels like it’s always in need of recharging. Almost everything else from last time is improved. It’s slightly smaller. The build quality is much better. It’s faster.

Having said that it’s still no iPad. While fast*er* it still feels sluggish compared with Apple’s tablet, the screen is a lot worse and the software library is laughable by comparison. But, as before, it’s also a tenth of the price. As an almost disposable consumption device, I have few complaints.
