“[The Good Life](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000754.php)” is this weeks PhotoFriday theme but also conjures up an image of an idyllic, simpler life-style. I thought this pastoral scene, actually taken in [Oslo](/travel/norway.html)‘s Folk Museum in Bygdøy, fitted the bill quite nicely.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Surreal](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=752).” I’m entry number 210.
