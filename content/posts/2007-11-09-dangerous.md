[![Snake](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/10817614934_a776695684.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817614934/ "Snake by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Dangerous](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000718.php).” This is my entry.

This picture is for my wife. In fact, I’ve no idea what kind of snake this is, or whether it’s dangerous or not, but people are often scared of them. This image was taken in [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks competition, “[Strength](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=716).” I’m entry 122.
