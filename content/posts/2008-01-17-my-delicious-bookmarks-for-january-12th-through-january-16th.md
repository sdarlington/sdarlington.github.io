- [Apple introduces new Apple TV software, lowers hardware pricing](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/01/15/apple_introduces_new_apple_tv_software_lowers_hardware_pricing.html) – Now potentially more useful with the movie rentals. But where is the price drop in the UK?!
- [Dell tells customer ‘Mac is good option’](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/16/dell_mac_good_option/) – “Now, it’s possible that the techie was referring to a 1970s rock band, or to an item of waterproof clothing. But we can’t help concluding that he was indeed talking about Apple’s operating system.”
- [Steve Jobs gets cohesive](http://www.macworld.com/article/131592/2008/01/keynotereax.html) – Some cool stuff from Apple at the MacExpo. I think the Time Capsule is going to be on my shopping list when it ships next month. The movie rentals (when they get to the UK) look interesting but they really need to build their catalogue!
- [How to recognise a good programmer](http://www.inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer/) – Great discussion on recognising great developers. The problem would seem to be finding them! Most recruiters just pattern match on CVs which tends to favour the “career” developer.
