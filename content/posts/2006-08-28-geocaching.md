I was introduced to the strange world of [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com "Geocaching") over Christmas last year.

For the uninitiated, geocaching is, basically, a high-tech scavenger hunt. People hide things all over the world, typically Tupperware boxes containing various goodies, and post the co-ordinates on a website. Other people then enter the details into their [GPS systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gps "Global Positioning System") and try to find them. It sounds simple, silly even, but it can give you a good excuse to look around an old and familiar area with a new perspective.

As the above picture shows, some caches are more tricky to find than others. Here we tried a “multi-cache,” which has various clues pointing to the real location. We found all the clues but couldn’t find the actual box.

The next day, [after lunch in a pub](http://www.roseandcrownwimbledon.co.uk/ "My favourite Sunday afternoon pub"), we decided to look for another geocache. Things were not looking good for a while but just as we were about to give up and go home — two failures in as many days — we found it!

Here B and D celebrate our find. It’s the first time D has been and she got quite into it!
