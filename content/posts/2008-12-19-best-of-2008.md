It was hard to pick my “[best of 2008](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000835.php).” I’ve taken well over four digits worth of images from five countries ([Denmark](/travel/copenhagen-denmark.html), [Italy](/travel/tuscany-italy.html), [Czech Republic, Germany](/travel/cycling-from-the-czech-republic-to-germany.html) and [Portugal](/travel/lisbon-portugal.html)) as well as back home. In the end I chose this one as it’s a kind of photography that I don’t normally even try and it worked out okay.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/weathered.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Weathered](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=833).” I’m entry number 236.
