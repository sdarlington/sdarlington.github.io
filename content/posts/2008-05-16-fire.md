It’s still early here in the UK so I’m not sure that you wanted to see a whole pig being roasted on a fire! Hence for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Fire](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000773.php),” I have this picture of a [New York City](/travel/new-york-2006.html) fire engine.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Professional](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=771).” I’m entry 158.
