The difficulty with this weeks challenge, “[Countryside](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001204.php),” was which picture to use? I’m not really patient enough to be a great landscape photographer but I’ve got lucky a few times, including this time in Ireland.

I’ve not posted an entry for the last week or two, so there’s no suggestion to vote for my entry this week!
