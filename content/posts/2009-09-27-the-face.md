I’m not sure how well this image fits the theme of “[The Face](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000915.php).” It’s certainly *a* face, but *the* face? Still, it’s one of my better early portraits that was not of my family.

He looked after a temple in [Tibet](/travel/tibet.html). We were expected to tip him on the way out and I didn’t have any change so I ended up having to give a reasonably large denomination note. I decided to get value for money by taking a few pictures.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/plants.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Plants](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=913).” I’m entry number 197.
