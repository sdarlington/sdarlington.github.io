In my mind I have it that I’m great at spotting tiny little details and photographing them. I assumed that would make this PhotoFriday challenge, “[Found Objects](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000756.php),” to be easy. Turns out that I was wrong — there’s very little appropriate in my iPhoto library! But I found this image from my [Cuba](/travel/cuba.html) collection and quite liked the fanned… thing.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[The Good Life](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=754).” I’m entry number 254.
