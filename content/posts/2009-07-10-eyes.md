For this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Eyes](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000892.php),” I was very tempted to use the image I took for the “[Extreme Closeup](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/extreme-closeup.html)” challenge but then realised that it was only a couple of months ago, a bit too soon to use it again.

Instead I picked the above picture of [Lena](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/lena.html), which was taken in my first time working in a studio. It’s actually a crop of a picture I normally use in black and white.
