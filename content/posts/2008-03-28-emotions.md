[![Local girl, Hoi An, Vietnam](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/10817755893_6af8706284.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817755893/ "Local girl, Hoi An, Vietnam by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I like this picture of a local child I took in [Hoi An, Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html). Obviously a little nervous, approaching me with some trepidation, but happy and smiling. I think this mixture of [emotions works for this weeks PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000758.php) challenge.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Found Objects](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=756).” I’m entry number 275.
