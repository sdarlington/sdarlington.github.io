There are a few pictures that I took when I was in [Stockholm](/travel/stockholm-sweden.html) that I didn’t include in that blog because they’re not really *of* Sweden even though that’s exactly where they were taken. This is the first of, well, a few. I think it nicely conjures up thoughts of spring and the coming of summer.
