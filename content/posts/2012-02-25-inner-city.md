This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Inner City](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001164.php),” the meaning of which varies depending on where you are. In the UK and some other places it often refers to a slightly run-down, residential part of a a city, which is the meaning I’ve gone for with this shot, taken the [Czech Republic](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-from-czech-republic-to-germany-decin-to-pirna.html).

I didn’t post an entry to last weeks challenge so there’s no pressure to vote for me this time!
