I thought that this image was suitable for the “[Monochrome](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000884.php)” theme for a number of reasons. It was taken on black and white film (Ilford XP2) and, even on colour film it would have been pretty monochromatic. It was taken in [Vigland Park, Oslo](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/norway.html).
