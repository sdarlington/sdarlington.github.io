- [Rejoice this day!](http://thisisindexed.com/2010/04/a-rerun-as-requested-rejoice-this-day/) – My sentiments exactly!
- [Lost labels for your DHARMA Initiative needs](http://maxpictures.com/weblog/2007/04/10/lost-labels-for-your-dharma-initiative-needs/) – This is great. I think I'm going to have to re-label everything in the cupboard at home!
