Photography is all about light, which makes this weeks PhotoFriday challenge rather challenging, “[Black](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000829.php)” being the absence of light. The best I’ve been able to do is this silhouette picture, taken in [Oslo, Norway](/travel/norway.html).

There’s a story about this image. I went to Norway shortly after buying my first SLR and, since I knew that I was going to be there for a while, decided to experiment with a few different kinds of film (this being [Ilford XP2](http://www.ilfordphoto.com/products/product.asp?n=11)). I thought the contrast here worked well and was pretty pleased with the result.

I showed it to a colleague who asked whether I got the idea from the “Lonely Planet” guide. I hadn’t, but he was right. On the article about Vigland Park was an almost identical image.
