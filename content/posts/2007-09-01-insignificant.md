This weeks PhotoFriday challenge is “[Insignificant](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000698.php).” Here is my entry.

This was taken in [Georgia](/travel/georgia.html) (the country not the US state). Note the two walkers in the middle distance. They’re pretty insignificant compared with the grandeur of the surrounding Caucus.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Unfinished](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=696).” I’m entry number 243.
