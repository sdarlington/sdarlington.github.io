![Lena](/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/lena.jpg "Lena")

Like most people, most of my photography tends to happen when I [travel](/travel/). I do like to branch out from time to time though, this time into [portrait](/tag/portraiture) photography. This picture is from my first (and currently only) experience in a studio and is of a model called Lena. She was professional, fun and very keen on motor racing.

This is a cropped version of the original. I usually use the [full-size, black and white version](http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=2953779) which is not suitable for work.
