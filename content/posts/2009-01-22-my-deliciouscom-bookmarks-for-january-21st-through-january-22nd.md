- [NetNewsWire and iPhone-Sized Data](http://daringfireball.net/2009/01/netnewswire_iphone_sized_data) – "Lesson learned: It’s not enough for an iPhone app to sport an iPhone-optimized user interface. It needs iPhone-sized data, too." I agree with this in principle but I've been thinking how I'd apply it to my iPhone application, Yummy, and coming up with a blank. How can you decide in advance which bookmarks you'll want to see? Most recent? Those with a particular tag? I can't think of an option other than 'all.'
- [The Inauguration of President Barack Obama](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/01/the_inauguration_of_president.html) – In case you're not sick of the inauguration already, here are some great images of the day.
- [Gordon Brown withdraws plan to keep details of MPs' expenses secret](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/21/mps-expenses) – "The PM said proposals for reforms of MPs' expenses would provide 'more transparency' than in most other parliaments around the world." I'm not convinced that this is a standard we should aspire to. Let's face it, our parliament is more open that North Korea and less tyrannical than Iran's but really that's not much of an achievement.
