This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Boy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000595.php). My entry was taken in Vietnam. A whole group of kids came out to see us. I don’t think they see many foreigners in this area.

Please also vote my my entry in last weeks competition, [Silver](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=593 "PhotoFriday"). I’m entry 244 (“–&gt; Stephen &lt;--").
