It’s that time of year where every magazine and website does a retrospective, regurgitating old material with no shame. I didn’t want to miss out this year. Digging into my Google Analytics logs I found the following…

Ten most read pages this year:

1. [Installing Oracle 10g XE on CentOS 4](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/installing-oracle-10g-express-edition-on-centos-4.html). This page was actually 35% more popular this year than last despite the ageing versions of both Linux and Oracle
2. [Sri Lanka](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/srilanka.html). This has been one of my most popular pages for years, although it took a 50% dive in page impressions this year due to the loss of a single referrer
3. [Oracle on Linux Installation Howto](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/oracle-howto.html)
4. [Minolta Dual Scan II film scanner review](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/dualscanii.html). Another surprise given the age of the scanner and the rise of digital cameras
5. [Belkin WiFi (Skype) Phone review](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/review-belkin-wi-fi-phone.html)
6. [Photobook Group Test (Part 1)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-group-test-part-1.html)
7. [Printing-1 Photobook Review (Part 1)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-test-printing-1.html)
8. [Photobook Group Test (Part 3)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-group-test-part-3.html)
9. [Sophia Smith](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/sophia-smith.html)
10. [Photobook Group Test (Part 4)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-group-test-part-4.html)

Somehow [part two of my photobook group test](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-group-test-part-2.html) slipped out of the top ten.

I immediately noticed that no post *from* this year made it into the list, so here’s the Top Ten posts from this year:

1. [YoPhoto Photobook Review (Part 1)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-test-yophoto.html)
2. [YoPhoto Photobook Review (Part 2)](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photo-book-test-results-yophoto.html)
3. [Eight Best Computer Books](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/eight-best-computer-books.html)
4. [Cycling from the Czech Republic to Germany](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-from-the-czech-republic-to-germany.html)
5. [Byline Bypass](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/byline-bypass.html)
6. [PhotoFriday: My Little Secret](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/my-little-secret.html)
7. [PhotoFriday: The Great Outdoors](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-great-outdoors.html)
8. [PhotoFriday: Autumn](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/autumn.html)
9. [PhotoFriday: Disastrous](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/disastrous.html)
10. [PhotoFriday: Tools](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/tools.html)

A number of my favourite posts of the year didn’t make the popularity grade. I had a good smattering, with some decent IT articles ([1](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/check-boxes.html) [2](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/net-neutrality-privacy-and-hypocrisy.html)), a large number about developing my iPhone application Yummy ([1](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/just-for-fun.html) [2](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/software/yummy-prepare-for-launch.html) [3](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/what-price.html) [4](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/software/yummy-ready-for-sale.html) [5](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/competitive-threat.html) [6](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/advertising-your-iapp.html) [7](http://www.zx81.org.uk/computing/opinion/growing-up-in-public.html)) and I was quite pleased with my movie poster edits ([1](http://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/hullboy.html) [2](http://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/saw-w.html)).

Overall it was a busy year! Thanks for reading. I’m sure I’ll be back with more in 2009. Stay tuned.
