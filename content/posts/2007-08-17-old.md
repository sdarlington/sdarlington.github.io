This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Old](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000694.php "PhotoFriday: Old").” Here is my entry. It is the partial roof of an amphitheatre in Aspendos, [Turkey](/travel/turkey.html "Turkey pictures"). Dating from Roman times, I think it counts as ‘old’!

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, [Oddity](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=692 "PhotoFriday: Oddity"). I’m entry 214.
