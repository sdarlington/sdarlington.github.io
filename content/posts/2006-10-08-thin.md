This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Thin](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000603.php "PhotoFriday: Thin"). My entry is number 318, and is of one of the cables supporting the Golden Gate Bridge in the San Francisco Bay area. From a distance they look far too *thin* to support such a large structure.
