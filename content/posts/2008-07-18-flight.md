Why, you might ask, is a ride on a large ferris wheel called a “[Flight](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000791.php)“? Your guess is as good as mine but I think it might have something to do with the [London Eye’s](http://www.londoneye.com/) original sponsor, British Airways. Whatever the reason, I thought this image made a good candidate for this weeks PhotoFriday. It was taken on my [second “flight,”](/blog/the-big-day.html) the first being a [couple of years earlier](/travel/misc2003.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[The Office](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=789).” Mine is number 133.
