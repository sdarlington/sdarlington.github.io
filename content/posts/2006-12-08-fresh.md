This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Fresh](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000621.php "PhotoFriday: Fresh"). I include this image partly because it’s taken in a market that was overflowing with *fresh* fruit, but mainly because it always amuses me. The sleeping lady was, seconds later, woken by her colleague laughing at me taking the picture.
