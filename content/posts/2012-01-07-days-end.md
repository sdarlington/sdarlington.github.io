What better way to celebrate the end of a hard day than a relaxing glass of beer? Well, that’s what I think anyway, and so it was the first thing that sprang to mind when I saw this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Day’s End](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001150.php).”

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Best of 2011](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1148).” I’m entry number 121.
