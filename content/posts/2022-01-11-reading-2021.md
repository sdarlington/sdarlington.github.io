I failed to reach my target of reading twelve books in 2021 by quite some margin this year. I finished only ten books, and that’s including the cheat of counting two short stories as two books!

Despite my objective of reading more fiction, I also failed with that (just [the one novel](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/sweet-caress.html) and the two short stories).

While the volume was down both on previous years and my target, the quality was actually pretty good. From the story of the [company behind the BlackBerry](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/losing-the-signal.html) to the [story of the Seventies](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/crisis-what-crisis.html), [how to build a computer](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software.html) and [how computers were made](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/the-computers-that-made-britain.html). All were worth a read.

The low-light was undoubtedly Malcom Gladwell’s “[Talking to Strangers](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/talking-to-strangers.html).” A reasonable “long read” blog post but stretched very thin over an entire book.

For 2022 I have the same target as 2021. Will I do better this time? Watch this space…

Talking of which, what is the point of these posts? Are they reviews? Not really, they’re thoughts or recollections or highlights of reading the books. Some read more like reviews, others are tangents, things that reading the book made me think about or consider in a new light.
