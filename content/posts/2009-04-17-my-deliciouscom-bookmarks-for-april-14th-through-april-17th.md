- [Three Cheers for Afghan Women](http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/three-cheers-for-afghan-women/) – it's a little depressing to think that, as the article notes, this is actually progress.
- [Audio slideshow: Sir Clement Freud](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8002592.stm) – I only really know Clement Freud for his contribution to Just A Minute. I remember that I wasn't sure what to make of him when I first heard his lists and slow, deliberate delivery, but that changed pretty quickly. It won't be the same without him.
- [Laptop Hunters: Homeless Frank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbJSuduTrPs&feature=player_embedded) – If you've not seen Microsoft's new adverts this probably won't make much sense. If you have, you'll realise that Frank's analysis of the PCs is more nuanced that the supposedly "real" people in the original videos.
