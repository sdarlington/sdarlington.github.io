Ever since I’ve been “into” Macs, Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference has been a draw. As an [iPhone developer](http://www.yummyapp.com/) this years was especially interesting to me. Unfortunately it’s not a full time job to me so it was hard to justify the time off work or the expense of the ticket.

I was, however, in the Bay Area just before the event and managed to have a quick walk around Moscone. I felt a bit geeky taking pictures of a trade conference, but I wasn’t the only one doing so and I didn’t have my nose pressed against the glass unlike certain people!

I took a look at all the icons outside. I didn’t see Yummy, though.
