When you think of [Noisy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000886.php) and loud musical instruments, one that springs to my mind is the bagpipe. In [Jerash, Jordan](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/jordan-jerash.html), they were not only loud but very unexpected.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Monochrome](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=884).” I’m entry number 78.
