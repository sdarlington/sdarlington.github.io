You’ve almost certainly seen that Wikipedia is kinda-sorta offline today [protesting a proposed US law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative/Learn_more) that would effectively give copyright holders the ability to blacklist pretty much any website without judicial review.

While rights holders do have legitimate concerns over people taking content without paying for it — I don’t like to call in piracy or theft — this really isn’t the answer. [Wired sums it up nicely](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/why-weve-censored-wired-com/all/1?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29):

> SOPA and PIPA represent a legal strategy that focuses the attention of business leaders on stopping losses rather than promoting innovation and building new products. It obfuscates the fact that piracy is, in the long run, an unavoidable cost of doing business, one that should be bearable provided the fundamentals of the business (say, customer satisfaction) are sound.

If there’s one thing that the iTunes Store taught us, it’s the people will actually pay for convenience.

But the first word, and therefore this final word, goes [go to TheOatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/sopa), who makes the point better by using an analogy involving kittens and flamethrowers. You should watch the whole thing.
