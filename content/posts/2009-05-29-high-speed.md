[![Rally of Corsica](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/11995894005_b542878dfa.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11995894005/ "Rally of Corsica by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

The cars in the Rally of [Corsica](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/corsica.html) were zipping through the streets at High Speeds, which I thought made this a good candidate for this weeks [PhotoFriday challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000880.php).
