This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Purple](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000700.php).” Here is my entry.

This is a picture of an aubergine (eggplant) that we’re going to be eating in a curry very shortly! My tripod has gone walk-about so this was taken using an image stabiliser making it less sharp than I would have liked.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Insignificant](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=698).” I’m entry number 224.
