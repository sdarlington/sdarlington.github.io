*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

I was an atheist long before the [four horsemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism) arrived on the scene in the mid-2000s. Their writing did clarify my thinking and made me consider aspects that I’d not come across before. Like [How to be a Liberal](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/how-to-be-a-liberal-2.html), it also gave me names for concepts that I had previously been aware of.

I probably could have put any of the [Dawkins](https://amzn.to/4ety4yw), [Harris](https://amzn.to/3YbxMGN), [Hitchens](https://amzn.to/3XXsUnm) or [Dennett](https://amzn.to/3NcmYlF) \[affiliate links\] books in the list, but there’s something about Hitchens takes-no-prisoners writing that pipped the others to the post here. (I found Dennett’s a little disappointing, to be honest. Probably a good thing I never did philosophy at university.)
