**Welcome to the Oracle Comedy Errors Page!**

This page is dedicated to all those frustrating hours that you have to spend fiddling about with Oracle just to get it working as it says it does on the box.

These are just things that have happened to me and the projects that I have been involved in. To make a really complete Oracle Comedy Errors Page we need your input.

For those that have already contributed, there is always [this](about.html) page. It also catalogues the projects and Oracle software that I’ve used to build up this list.

**Why is this page here?**

There seems to be a great number of people who are only too eager to bash Microsoft, but only a few who seem to hate Oracle. Looking at their products, I thought that there must be at least a few sympathetic souls on the net. A quick search on [HotBot](http://www.hotbot.com) and [Altavista](http://www.altavista.com) seems to indicate otherwise.

To rectify this shameless situation, I aim to produce, if not the first, then the definitive list of Oracle cock-ups and anecdotes. Naturally, I can’t do this all on my own; there are others.

I can supply the TAR numbers if you don’t believe me…
