[![Is it any wonder that there's confusion?](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8503192056_13f87d5acb.jpg?resize=295%2C121)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/8503192056/ "Is it any wonder that there's confusion? by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I found this while (mis)typing the caption to [yesterdays photo competition](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/keep-it-simple.html "Keep It Simple").
