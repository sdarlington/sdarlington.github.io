In my mind, this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[The Weekend](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000858.php),” is linked with the “[Morning Routine](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/morning-routine.html)” theme a couple of weeks ago. I guess that’s my fault for using my weekend breakfast routine last time. I fought the temptation to use the same image, and instead used this spot we used for brunch a couple of times when we were in [Lille, France](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lille-2006.html).

Seems that pretty much every theme goes back to food these days. What does that say about me?

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/isolation.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Isolation](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=856).” I’m entry number 276.
