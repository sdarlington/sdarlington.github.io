The [Amazon Fire 7″](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00Y3TM6CO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00Y3TM6CO&linkCode=as2&tag=zx81orguk)![](http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zx81orguk&l=as2&o=2&a=B00Y3TM6CO) falls very much into the “good for the money” category. If you compare it to an iPad you’re going to come away disappointed. The screen is terrible. Viewing angles are not great, the colours are washed-out and it’s low resolution by modern standards. Battery life could be better. The case feels cheap and it creaks a bit when you squeeze it. And the app selection is nowhere near what you get in Apple’s (or even Google’s) eco-system.

But — and it’s a big but — it’s a tenth of the price of an iPad. And, if all you want to do it watch Netflix and BBC iPlayer, it’s perfectly adequate and well worth £50.
