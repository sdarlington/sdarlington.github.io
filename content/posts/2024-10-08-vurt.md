*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

When I completed this series on Mastodon, I wrote about Pollen. This was a mistake. Not because Pollen is a bad book, but because it’s the followup to [Vurt](https://amzn.to/4dGGzoB) \[affiliate link\]. It was Vurt that I was thinking of. You should read both of them, but you should start with Vurt.

Unfortunately for me, it’s quite a difficult book to explain. It’s kind of cyberpunk with psychedelics. But the thing that made it stand out to me was the setting. Whereas most other cyberpunk books were set in Japan or China or San Francisco, this was set in grey and drizzly Manchester, in the north of England.

It’s strange but compelling.
