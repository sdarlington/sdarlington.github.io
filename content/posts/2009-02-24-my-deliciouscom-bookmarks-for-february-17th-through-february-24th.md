- [Does University Challenge really test intelligence?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7907861.stm) – No. Knowing a bunch of obscure facts isn't intelligence. If that's the measure, then Wikipedia is way smarter than Einstein or Newton or Gauss or Darwin.
- [Review: Canon EOS 5D Mark II](http://www.macworld.com/article/138884/2009/02/canon_eos_5d_mark_2.html?lsrc=rss_main) – If anyone wants to buy 5000 copies of Yummy so that I can afford one of these I'd very much appreciate it.
- [Creationists are still denying Darwin. Stephen Moss asks why](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/17/evolution-versus-creationism-science) – "What worries me about many of her fellow creationists is that they begin with the Bible and then start looking for scientific evidence to back up what their faith tells them is true." That and the fact that they keep coming up with the same arguments.
