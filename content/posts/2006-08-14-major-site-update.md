If you’ve been to ZX81 before you can’t fail to notice that we’ve had the second major redesign in our history. This time we’ve moved over to using [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/), the unfortunate consequence of which is that some of the old links might have stopped working. I’ve tried hard to maintain things, but there may be some problems. Let me know if you find them!

*\[ Edit: Some people are using my pictures on their web pages, in most cases this is both uncredited and without permission. This is an infringement of my copyright. As you might imagine, I have made no attempt to maintain links for these people. For a short time this may also inconvenience people coming from Google Images. \]*

The other thing you’ll notice is a lot of new posts. That’s because I’ve decided to consolidate my two most active websites, that is the largely technical *zx81* and the more personal *stephendarlington.com*. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly maintaining two sites is just significantly more work than one. I guess I should have seen this coming but keeping them separate seemed like a good idea at the time. The second reason is that the division between the two is somewhat arbitrary and not entirely useful.

People with registered accounts at *stephendarlington.com* should find their accounts present here but it may be necessary to reset the password.

Let me know what you think of this new site and whether you think merging the two together is a good idea.
