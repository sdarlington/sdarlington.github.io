<span style="font-size: inherit; font-weight: 400;">If there’s one thing to take away from “</span>[The Problem With Men](https://amzn.to/2JxHYpK)<span style="font-size: inherit; font-weight: 400;">” is that there </span>*is*<span style="font-size: inherit; font-weight: 400;"> an International Men’s Day and it’s on November 19th. Is that two things?</span>

But you probably knew that.

The problem with this book is that it’s very much preaching to the choir. If you’re un-ironically asking when International Men’s Day is on March 8th, this book is not likely to be on your radar.

That’s a shame as it nicely lays out the argument for International Women’s Day, equality, feminism and counters many of the rather odd objections. The chapters are mostly questions, from “What’s wrong with asking when is International men’s day on International Women’s Day?” to “Can a man really be a feminist?” It’s short — one chapter is a single word! — to the point and amusing.

In summary, it’s a must-read for the very people who won’t read it.
