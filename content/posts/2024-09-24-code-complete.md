*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

I was given the first edition of [Code Complete](https://amzn.to/3Xyw4xU) \[affiliate link\] in a training course in my first job, post-university. My Computer Science degree covered a number of sophisticated but impractical techniques for software engineering, the most memorable being testing. By comparison, Code Compete was incredibly refreshing. Its advice is practical and pragmatic, yet based on solid research and experience. It also rarely says “this is *the* way” to do something. Instead, it will list the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. I treat with suspicion anyone who advocates for One True Way to do something.
