\[photopress:boosh3.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]Okay, really I’m talking about [The Mighty Boosh](http://www.themightyboosh.inuk.com/), but my camera phone doesn’t quite have the resolution to give you much more than a blur…

A few months ago I tried to organise a trip to see The Boosh but despite every indication to the contrary, they had completely sold out. We settled for [watching the DVD at a friends house](http://bcuk.blogspot.com/2006/03/coconuts-and-cupcakes.html).

On a whim I checked a ticketing website last Friday and there were still tickets available for some new dates that were added. After umming and ahhing over the price for a while I whipped out my credit card.

The show was kind of a mixture of some new material, some “best of” moments from the TV series and a lot of ad-libbing. That’s selling it a bit short. It was a new story but with some familiar elements and some favourite characters. We were pleased to see The Moon (“Neil Armstrong, walking on me face…”) make an appearance.

Basically it’s a programme full of in-jokes. You could go to an Eddie Izzard gig and laugh at pretty much all of it (except any references to Mrs Badcrumble). If you’d not seen [the TV show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/ "The Mighty Boosh on BBC3") would the phrase “top shelf” make you laugh out loud?

We were laughing pretty much from beginning to end. Recommended.
