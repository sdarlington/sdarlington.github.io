The story behind this image is that [a friend](http://www.alaska2argentina.co.uk/ "Annette's website") was managing [a band](http://www.musicrollexchange.com/ "Music Roll Exchange") and, as a cunning ploy to get me to come to one of their gigs, suggested I take some photographs. I had never taken pictures at a live venue before and so decided to have a go.
