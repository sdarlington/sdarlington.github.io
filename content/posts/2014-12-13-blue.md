This weeks PhotoFriday them is “[Blue](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1458)” and these are [bluebells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthoides_non-scripta) (I think), which should count, even though there aren’t technically blue.

I didn’t enter last weeks challenge, so I’m not going to insist that you vote for me. (In fact, the last time I forgot to even vote for myself!)
