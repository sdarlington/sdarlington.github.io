I have recently installed Oracle 8i R3 (8.1.7) on my Celeron 466 machine. I found the installation to be very straight-forward compared with both 8.1.5 and the experiences of many people.

My machine is well below the specification that would be required to do real work on, especially if you have a number of developers. It does work, albeit rather slowly. Creating my initial database, for example, took around eight hours.

It currently runs RedHat 7.2 with a few minor patches (including a more recent kernel). I installed just about everything, including the full development kit and “glibc-compat”.

My secret to success, I believe, were these two commands:

1. `. /usr/i386-glibc21-linux/bin/i386-glibc21-linux-env.sh`
2. <code.>export LD\_ASSUME\_KERNEL=2.2.5</code.>

After this, the installation ran exactly to plan.
