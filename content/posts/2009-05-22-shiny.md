My entry for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Shiny](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000878.php),” was taken at the changing of the guard ceremony in [Stockholm](/travel/stockholm-sweden.html). I was very impressed with their smart and shiny uniforms and astonished when they started playing the Indiana Jones theme music shortly afterwards.
