No PhotoFriday today, but I thought I’d post a picture of the day anyway. I picked this one partly because [Georgia](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/georgia.html) has been in the news a lot recently but mainly because if there’s one thing that got me interested in photography and wanting to learn more, this image is it.

I know there’s a lot wrong with it technically, but it does still kind of work I think.
