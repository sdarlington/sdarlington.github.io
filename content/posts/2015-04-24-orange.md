I went through quite a few thoughts and pictures before I settled on this one for the PhotoFriday theme “[Orange](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1496).” I went clever-but-not-in-the-spirit picture of a wind-farm in [*Orange* county](/travel/wind-farms.html), then obvious photographs of oranges or orange sweets. But I finally went for this rust on a canon in [Rhodes](/travel/rhodes-town-greece.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Wet](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1494).” I’m entry number 64.
