When I think of “Fast Food” — this weeks PhotoFriday theme — I think of burgers and pizzas and, generally, stuff that I don’t cook myself! The ultimate in fast food is a dish that takes none of my time! This steak sandwich was photographed and consumed at the [Royal Exchange](http://royalexchange.com/) in [San Francisco](/travel/san-francisco.html).
