I thought I’d go for the double meaning again for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Awful!](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000793.php)” In the most common usage it means *[extremely bad](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awful)*. The weather in the above shot, taken on a [December trip to Iceland](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/iceland.html), was undoubtedly awful.

\[photopress:DSC00011.JPG,thumb,alignleft\]However, the original meaning of the word was “full of awe” (we tend to use “awesome” these days[^1]). In this sense, geysirs shooting water high into the sky was an awful sight.

The thumbnail to the left (click to zoom in) was my second choice of picture. The PT Cruiser was a [truly awful car](http://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/worst-car-ever.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Flight](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=791).” I’m entry number 150.
