The United Arab Emirates was not anywhere near the top of my list of places to visit, but I went anyway. (Now I think about it, [neither was Georgia](/travel/georgia.html)!) This time it was for work rather than strictly as a tourist, but I did have enough time to have a look around Abu Dhabi and take a few pictures. At the bottom are a couple from Dubai too, although, generally, those pictures did not come out quite as well.

If the pictures have piqued your interest, there are a few web sites that you might want to visit:

- [Emirates Net](http://www.emirates.net.ae). The local ISP and phone company.
- [Arab.Net](http://www.arab.net). Lots of information on the middle-east as a whole.
- You’re going to need a guide while travelling around. And since you’ll find there’s not a lot to see in UAE you may as well get a guide on the whole region rather than just the Emirates. As always, there’s a Lonely Planet guide. You can buy a copy from Amazon ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0864427018/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0864427018/zx81orguk00)).
