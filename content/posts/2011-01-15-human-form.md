[![Statues in Vigeland park, Oslo, Norway.](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4127/5195011457_8e5b313a9d.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5195011457/ "Statues in Vigeland park, Oslo, Norway. by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I’m slightly cheating for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “Human Form.” This image is technically not human but it’s confused a few people in the past so I figure it qualifies.

(My main hesitation in using this picture is that I’ve used it [twice](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/black.html) [before](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/monochrome.html). But I like it so I’m sticking with it!)

Please also vote on [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/suburbia.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Suburbia](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1047).” I’m entry number 146.
