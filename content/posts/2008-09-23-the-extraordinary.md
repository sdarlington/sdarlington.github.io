Another late entry this week — I hope you remembered to vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/relationship.html) in [last weeks challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=807)!

“[The Extraordinary](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000809.php)” is the challenge this week. With enough intellectual curiosity, almost anything can be considered extraordinary. The world is populated with so many amazing landscapes, sights and creatures that it was difficult to know where to start but in the end I settled on these jellyfish at [Monterey Bay Aquarium](/travel/monterey-bay-aquarium.html). In addition to being extraordinary, their diversity and beauty was completely unexpected.
