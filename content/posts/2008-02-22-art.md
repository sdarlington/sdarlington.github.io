This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Art](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000748.php)” and it looks as though most entries so far have been going for images “traditional” art or arty photographs. I thought I’d go a slightly different route, with a picture of some graffiti in [Lille](/travel/lille-2006.html), [France](/travel/alps-to-riviera-france-2005.html). I like the contrast between the usual, boring “I was here” graffiti and the figure in the bottom right.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Infinity](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=746).” I’m entry number 133.
