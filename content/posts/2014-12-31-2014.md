<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It’s important to have a Top 10 list. I know this as every other site has one. I don’t want to miss out. So here are the top ten most read posts here this year, with the year they were originally published in parenthesis:</span>

1. [QA Mindf\*\*k](/computing/opinion/qa-mindfk.html "QA Mindf**k")
2. [Do Apple take 40% in the EU?](/computing/opinion/do-apple-take-40-in-the-eu.html "Do Apple take 40% in the EU?") (2011)
3. [Learning Swift ](/computing/programming/learning-swift.html "Learning Swift")
4. [iOS Developer Program: from individual to company](/computing/opinion/ios-developer-program-from-individual-to-company.html "iOS Developer Program: from individual to company") (2011)
5. [How do I do “X” in Swift?](/computing/opinion/how-do-i-do-x-in-swift.html "How do I do “X” in Swift?")
6. [AQGridView to UICollectionView](/computing/opinion/aqgridview-to-uicollectionview.html "AQGridView to UICollectionView") (2013)
7. [iPhone Dev: Saving State ](/computing/software/iphone-dev-saving-state.html "iPhone Dev: Saving State")(2010)
8. [NSFetchedResultsController and iCloud](/computing/programming/nsfetchedresultscontroller-and-icloud.html "NSFetchedResultsController and iCloud")
9. [Why you need a crash reporter ](/computing/opinion/why-you-need-a-crash-reporter.html "Why you need a crash reporter")(2011)
10. [Sophia Smith](/photography/sophia-smith.html "Sophia Smith") (2006)

If there’s a lesson here in increasing readership it’s simple: get retweeted by people with lots of followers.

Honourable mentions go to the following as they were *written* this year but didn’t make it into the “most read” list:

14\. [Recruitment Tests](/computing/opinion/recruitment-tests.html "Recruitment Tests")  
15\. [Two Years](/blog/two-years.html "Two Years")  
16\. [Java and Yosemite](/computing/opinion/java-and-yosemite.html "Java and Yosemite")  
21\. [Starting Coding](/computing/opinion/starting-coding.html "Starting Coding")  
23\. [Swift Hate](/computing/opinion/swift-hate.html "Swift Hate")  
31\. [Lucky number two](/blog/lucky-number-two.html "Lucky Number Two")

I started with the intention of writing at least one blog a week. You’ll note that I utterly failed. I didn’t even get to the end of January with that!

The biggest surprises — since they were both written over a decade ago — were:

17\. [Italy, 2001](/travel/italy.html "Italy, 2001")  
19\. [Oracle 8i for Linux Installation HOWTO](/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/oracle-howto.html "Oracle 8i for Linux Installation HOWTO") (last edit was 2003)

I’m not going to make any promises or predictions about next year, other than I’ll be moving the site to a new web host (the old one closing down). But whatever happens, here’s to a great 2015.
