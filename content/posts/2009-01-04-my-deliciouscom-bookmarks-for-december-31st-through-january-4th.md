- [Mike Ash on Private APIs](http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/friday-qa-2009-01-02.html) – Nice discussion on the pros and cons of using private API's in your applications. The only time I've consciously used them was years ago with a large PL/SQL program on an Oracle database. I got all the upside (quicker development) without any of the down (having to maintain it). Yuk yuk.
- [Electric dreams for pop in 2009](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7784486.stm) – Apparently synth-pop is making a come-back for 2009. Yay! Less derivative guitar bands and more cheesy pop please!
- [2008 – The Year in Pictures](http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/photo/2008-year-in-pictures/) – Some really beautiful images in here. Wish my photography was up to their standard!
