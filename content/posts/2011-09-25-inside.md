[![Rain in Glen of Aherlow](https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6202/6109809234_e75b04ce1b.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/6109809234/ "Rain in Glen of Aherlow by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I thought for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, simply *being* “[Inside](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001121.php)” wasn’t quite enough. It had to *show* being inside which also implies that there’s an outside visible. So, here I was in Ireland, sat *inside* the car, waiting for the rain to subside. I thought that that made this a decent entry.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/glowing.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Glowing](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1119).” I’m entry number 184.
