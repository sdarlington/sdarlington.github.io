This weeks PhotoFriday challenge is [Destruction](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000605.php "PhotoFriday: Destruction"). My entry is a US tank left destroyed in Vietnam. I guess it did more than it’s fair share of destruction when operational.

Please vote for my entry in last weeks “[Thin](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=603 "PhotoFriday: Thin")” theme. I’m entry 318.
