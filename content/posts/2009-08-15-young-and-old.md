[![People viewing sunrise from top of Mount Sinai, Egypt](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5478/10817489046_31ba33ac04.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817489046/ "People viewing sunrise from top of Mount Sinai, Egypt by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This image is sunrise from the top of [Mount Sinai](/travel/egypt-mount-sinai.html) after a night climb with people of all ages, [Young and Old](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000902.php). This is not just a coincidence as this is this weeks PhotoFriday theme.

Please also vote for the previous challenge[^1], “[Cameraphone Shot](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=899).” I’m entry number 95.
[^1]: They skipped a week so I can’t say ‘last week’.
