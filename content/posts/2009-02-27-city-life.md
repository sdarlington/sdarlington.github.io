I always consider one of the constants of “[City Life](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000854.php)” — this weeks PhotoFriday — are rows of taxis. In London they’re usually black. In [New York](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/new-york-2006.html) they’re yellow. And there are a lot of them!

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/morning-routine.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Morning Routine](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=852).” I’m entry number 173.
