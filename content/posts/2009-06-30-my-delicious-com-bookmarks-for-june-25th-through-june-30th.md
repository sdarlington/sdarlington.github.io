- [Battle between ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro to be BBC4 comedy drama](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jun/30/martin-freeman-alexander-armstrong-sir-clive-sinclair-bbc4-drama) – This looks like it could be fun. I especially like some of the comments after the article. The Spectrum vs. Commode 64 \[sic\] debate still rages to this day…
- [Materials: The HTC Hero's Teflon Coating Makes the iPhone Feel Like Junk – iPhone 3G](http://gizmodo.com/5302637/htc-heros-teflon-coating-makes-the-iphone-feel-like-junk) – One thing that's holding me back from getting a 3GS is the plastic back. I much prefer the aluminium from the first gen model.
- [The blue and the green](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/24/the-blue-and-the-green/) – "Your eyes are not cameras faithfully taking pictures of absolute truth of all that surrounds you. They have filters, and your brain has to interpret the jangled mess it gets fed." A very neat optical illusion.
