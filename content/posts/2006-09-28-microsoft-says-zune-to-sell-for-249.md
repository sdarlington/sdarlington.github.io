I’ve refrained from commenting about Microsoft’s iPod competitor so far as it’s not much of a challenge to mock it when they decide to make one model dung-coloured.

However this article caught my eye:[](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2091)

[AppleInsider | Microsoft says Zune to sell for $249](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2091)

What the headline doesn’t tell you is that they are planning to make a loss on each unit to make that price-point, just like they do on each XBox games console. I can’t think of many other companies that would make a [loss of $388 million in one quarter](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9085 "MS Q1 2006 results") and consider that to be a good strategy worth replicating for another product.
