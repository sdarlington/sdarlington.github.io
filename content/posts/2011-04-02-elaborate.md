For this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Elaborate](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001071.php),” I wanted to show something with lots of tiny details. Not just a picture of something that has lots of small details, but an image that *shows* and makes it clear that the details that are visible are only the tip of the iceberg. There were a few that kind of worked, including pictures of the [Tokyo](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/japan-tokyo.html) Forum, dancing at this years Chinese New Year and some details on a building in New York, but I thought this image of the ceiling of the Natural History Museum in [Vienna](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/vienna-austria.html) caught it better.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/mother-nature.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Mother Nature](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1069).” I’m entry number 172.
