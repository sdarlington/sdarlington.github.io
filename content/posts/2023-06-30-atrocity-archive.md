<span style="font-size: revert;">I’m not sure that I can explain why it took me so long to read </span>[this Charlie Stross book](https://amzn.to/46r4mXl)<span style="font-size: revert;">. Some of the references to nineties computing tech dated it a little, but no more than Douglas Adams’ obsession with digital watches. The characters are pretty good, as is the writing. It strays into the mystical, magical world but there was always a logic underpinning the world. (The lack of “logic” in many fantasy books is one of the reasons I generally prefer sci-fi.)</span>

In that sense, I don’t know what to conclude. I quite enjoyed it but the fact that it took me a year to read surely says something?
