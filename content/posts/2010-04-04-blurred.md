As ever I had trouble with this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Blurred](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000969.php).” I have plenty of blurry pictures but this implies something a little more deliberate. So, this image of a speeding car in Wimbledon.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, [Pleasure](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=967).” I’m entry number 212.
