This weeks PhotoFriday challenge is “[Frozen](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1321)” and, I suppose, technically this snow might not actually be frozen. But snow is something you think of when you the word frozen comes up so I think it’s a valid interpretation of the theme! It was taken (in July!) near [Lake Tahoe](/travel/lake-tahoe.html "Lake Tahoe").
