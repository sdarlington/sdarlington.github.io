I was going to say that it was second time lucky with the weather but really that’s the difference between [going to Brighton in April](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/brighton.html) and going in August. Certainly, there was no-one grilling sausages on the beach last year.

In the late afternoon we walked all the way to the Marina and back, which meant shooting straight into the sun to get an image of the iconic pier.

I tried a bunch of different angles and meter readings to vary the amount of texture and depth versus silhouette. One of the nice things about the 50D (compared with the 300D I had before it) is that it is so quick to use meaning that I could try a number of variations.

This is also the first day of shooting that I have processed using Apple’s Aperture software. The difference between it and iPhoto is not quite as great as that between the 50D and 300D but it certainly sped up the editing and tweaking.
