<span style="font-size: revert;">I’ve been working from home for five years. I started well before the pandemic and, like many who have tried it, would have a hard time going back to an office full time. However, I used to spend my commute reading. In those years I have not managed to consistently find time to just sit and read.</span>

What I’m saying is that 2022, from a book reading perspective, has gone not got well, even worse than [2021](/blog/reading-2021.html)! I have only completed [four](/tag/reading2022) books. I enjoyed [two](/blog/cloud-without-compromise.html) of [them](/blog/the-art-of-leadership.html), the [other](/blog/radical-candor.html) [two](/blog/fact-and-fallacies-of-software-engineering.html) were a bit meh. Not actually *bad* but I wouldn’t say that they justified their word count.

Next year I am, possibly masochistically, sticking with a target of twelve books. I *hope* I can do better, even though history suggests I won’t. My backlog of reading material continues to grow and they are not going to read themselves.

At the same time, I am migrating from the Amazon-owned Good Reads to community-owned [BookWyrm](https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm), which is federated like Mastodon. I’m [here](https://ramblingreaders.org/user/sdarlington) if you want to follow my progress.
