- [It’s not an arsenic-based life form](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/its_not_an_arsenic-based_life.php) – Apparently ET is not visiting any time soon but it's still pretty cool.
- [Julian Assange, defending our democracies (despite their owners’ wishes)](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/12/the-nobel-peace-prize-for-2011.html) – Nice piece about WikiLeaks and why, despite what some politicians will tell you, it's a good thing.
