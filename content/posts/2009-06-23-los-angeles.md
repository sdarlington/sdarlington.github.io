The bizarre thing about Los Angeles. No, scrub that. *One* of the bizarre things about Los Angeles is that it doesn’t really have a distinct centre or downtown area, just a bunch of nearby districts, some more noteworthy than others.

Despite only having a day I think I did pretty well. After a decent brunch I managed to visit Hollywood, including the famous sign[^1], the [Grauman’s Chinese Theatre](http://www.manntheatres.com/chinese/), and [Hollywood Walk of Fame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame).

<div class="flickr-gallery tag" id="gallery-918bcd9d"><div class="fg-clear"></div> </div><div class="fg-clear"></div> <script type="text/javascript">
											jQuery(document).ready(function(){
							jQuery("#gallery-918bcd9d .flickr-thumb img").flightbox({size_callback: get_sizes});
						});
										
										//-->
				</script>In the afternoon I went a little out of town and saw the [Getty Museum](http://www.getty.edu/museum/) — not something I would have immediately associated with Los Angeles but well worth a visit in hindsight. And then, on the way back to the airport, I stopped briefly in Venice Beach.

The airport, by the way, is called John Wayne Airport. I guess there are plenty of airports named after people but that one, for some reason, amused me. Does that mean that I didn’t completely internalise the Los Angeles vibe?
[^1]: I did try to see it the previous evening but it clearly hadn’t been illuminated.
