The east coast of Rhodes has all the big name destinations, Faliraki and Lindos, but I figured that the west coast was worth a visit too.

The first thing that I passed (other than the airport which I wouldn’t be going to for another few days) was Pataloudes, better known as the [Valley of the Butterflies](http://www.rhodesguide.com/travelguide/rhodes_excursions.php?ssp=1). However, despite the name there were no butterflies.

[![Petaloudes](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5632214753_a9bca9d539.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5632214753/ "Petaloudes by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

There are two reasons for the lack of butterflies. The first is the time of year. The bugs are attracted to the damp, shaded part of the island during the main heat of the summer. The weather was decent in April but hardly what you’d describe as “the main heat.”

The other reason is more fundamental: even in summer, they’re moths and not butterflies, but they call them butterflies as that sounds much more attractive than “moth.”

[![Locked monastery](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5632215463_91b08b4f31.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5632215463/ "Locked monastery by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

But despite the lack of the animal that gave the place its (English language) name, it was still a pleasant walk. It wasn’t completely “back to nature.” There were maintained paths and bridges, making it more like [Muir Woods](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/muir-woods.html) than the [Peak District](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-country.html).

I followed the path all the way to the end, where I found another empty ticket gate. Just after that were (closed) stalls where a little later in the year lunch could be purchased. And just beyond, I saw on a map, was a monastery. However, as I got to the top of the hill I realised that the gate to it was closed. I had no choice but to return the way I had come, back to the car park.

Next stop was “[Ancient Kamiros](http://www.rhodesguide.com/travelguide/rhodes_monuments.php?ssp=9),” a well preserved 5C BC town. It was surprisingly large and the walls were very well preserved. As an added bonus, there were great views over the sea which was just a short distance away.

Like the acropolis in [Lindos](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lindos-and-rhodes-east-coast-greece.html), Kamiros closed shortly after I arrived. But I got lucky again and had seen pretty much everything I wanted to see before I was thrown out.

By this time it was getting quite late and I was pretty hungry, so before continuing down the coast I stopped at a water-side restaurant. They claim to have been open for several decades so I assumed that they can’t have given *too* many people upset stomachs!

[![Kritinia main square](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5632216919_6cf8333722.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5632216919/ "Kritinia main square by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

After Kamiros the next major sight was some distance away and I wasn’t sure that I would be able to make it there before the sun started setting. Still, I thought I should continue further south for a little while longer.

It was a beautiful drive. The road mostly hugged the coast, the sun was shining and there was very little other traffic.

After a while the road headed a little inland and I decided to stop at the next town. This town was called Kritinia, which was small, hilly and looked very sleepy. The town square had two guys chatting at a table and another guy leaning into one of the nearby houses deep in conversation with, presumably, whoever lived there.

Almost everything else looked closed, including the church, and the only other activity was a man feeding all the neighbourhood cats. Seeing a “normal” part of Rhodes seemed a fitting end point to my trip down the west coast. I turned round and headed back to to Rhodes Town.
