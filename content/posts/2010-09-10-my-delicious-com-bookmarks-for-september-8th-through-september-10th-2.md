- [Catholics, it’s you this Pope has abused](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-catholics-its-you-this-pope-has-abused-2074029.html) – Why even Catholics should Protest The Pope.
- [There’s more to colour than meets the eye](http://www.macuser.co.uk/2204-theres-more-to-colour-than-meets-the-eye) – Nice discussion of colours and what they "mean."
- [Compromising Twitter’s OAuth security system](http://arstechnica.com/security/guides/2010/09/twitter-a-case-study-on-how-to-do-oauth-wrong.ars/) – " What it comes down to is that OAuth 1.0a is a horrible solution to a very difficult problem. It works acceptably well for server-to-server authentication, but there are far too many unresolved issues in the current specification for it to be used as-is on a widespread basis for desktop applications. It's simply not mature enough yet." This is pretty much what I found implementing OAuth for Yahoo! in Yummy.
