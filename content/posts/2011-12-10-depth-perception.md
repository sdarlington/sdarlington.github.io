This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Depth Perception](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001143.php).” My entry was taken in a hotel in Frankfurt. I didn’t have my “proper” camera with me but I think my iPhone did a respectable job under the circumstances.

I didn’t post an entry to last weeks challenge, but I’m sure you voted for me in the previous weeks!
