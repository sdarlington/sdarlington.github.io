I couldn’t let the inaugural train journey betweeen Beijing and Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, go by without comment. It represents a huge shift for the Tibetans and, while it could bring some positive changes, it’s more likely to bring large numbers of Chinese and a quickening of the pace of the decline of their unique culture.

Wired has a nice article — “[Train to the Roof of the World](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.07/chinarail_pr.html)” — that takes a balanced view of the technology and politics. The BBC’s — “[First Beijing train reaches Lhasa](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/5140514.stm)” — is much shorter if you’re pushed for time!
