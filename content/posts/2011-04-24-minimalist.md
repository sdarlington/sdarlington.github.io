[![Old typewriter](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5057/5481870217_a72d7af541.jpg?resize=500%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5481870217/ "Old typewriter by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I don’t think this is my strongest ever entry to a PhotoFriday challenge, but I do think that this old typewriter fits the theme of “[Minimalist](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001077.php).” I am mainly referring to the minimalism of the picture itself, the almost monochrome look and the simplicity of it all. But you could also consider that by using a typewriter rather than a word processor you’d be keeping things simple and minimalist.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/lines.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Lines](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1075).” I’m entry number 268.
