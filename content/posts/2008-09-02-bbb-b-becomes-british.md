![B The Brit](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/b-new-idol.jpg?resize=500%2C333 "B The Brit")

Full news on [her own website](http://www.brandarling.com/2008/09/branbrit.html), but today B said her “Affirmation of allegiance” and gained British Nationality. She was a little unhappy about having to pledge allegiance to the Queen so I’ve made a minor edit to the original picture.

I commented that a lot of our government clearly have not had to make such a pledge themselves. If they too had to respect democracy and freedom I think we’d be hearing rather less about 42 days in gaol without trial and ID cards. (End of rant.)
