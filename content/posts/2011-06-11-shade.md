[![View from the Eiffel Tower](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4871613829_fb776b97d5.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4871613829/ "View from the Eiffel Tower by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This is another week where I’m not completely happy with the image I’ve ended up using. Sure, in this picture of [Paris](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/paris-part-deux.html) showing the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, there is “[Shade](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001091.php).” But is a shadow and shade the same thing? Not quite.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/people.html) in last weeks challenge, “[People](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1089).” I’m entry number 223.
