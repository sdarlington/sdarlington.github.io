- [A humanist discussion of… 'creationism'](http://bhascience.blogspot.com/2008/06/humanist-discussion-of-creationism-by.html) – A nice rebuttal of some of the more common "arguments" against evolution.
- [Classics in Lego](http://www.flickr.com/photos/balakov/sets/72157602602191858/) – Famous photographs in Lego. Fantastic!
- [A shaming victory on 42 days](http://dooooooom.blogspot.com/2008/06/shaming-victory-on-42-days.html) – The governments absurd law, allowing the Police to detail people for up to 42 days without charge, is not popular. Just hoping the Lords send it back with some rude comments attached.
