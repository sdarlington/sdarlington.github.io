Over the next few weeks, you’ll see a bunch of posts that I have previously shared elsewhere. (Plus the last couple of posts.) For the most part, the posts will be as-is. Each post with note where and when it came from, plus information on any changes.

I’m gradually closing down my Medium account, because of their continued “enshittification.” I didn’t post much there, and some of it can already be found here.

I’m also in the process of shutting down my software company (Wandle Software), and will be migrating some of the blogs from there.
