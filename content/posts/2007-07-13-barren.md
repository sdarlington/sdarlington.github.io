This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Barren](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000684.php "PhotoFriday: Barren").” Here is my entry. This picture was taken on the [Tibetan](/travel/tibet.html "My trip to Tibet") side of the Himalayas on the last day as we were about to head back into Nepal.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Busy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=682 "PhotoFriday: Busy").” I’m number 278 (“–&gt; Stephen &lt;–“).
