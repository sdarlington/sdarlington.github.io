In south-west London [the snow of the past few](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/drunk-snowman.html) days has given way to grey skies and rain, and the snow that still lies on the ground is more icy than crisp. I much preferred the snow.

Still, the melting allowed for photographs like the above. This is actually a shot through my living room window.
