Apparently today is “[Atheist Pride Day](http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/03/17/friday-is-atheist-pride-day/).” You are supposed to “change your Facebook profile picture to the \[Out Campaign Logo\] And change your status to something like ‘I am an atheist’ (or whatever).” I’m not on FaceBook so you’ll have to make do with this little post.

It turns out that the timing is quite good, too. Last night I went to a British Humanist Association talk by Daniel Dennett called “[A Darwinian Perspective on Religions: Past, Present and Future.](http://www.humanism.org.uk/meet-up/events/view/-1)” It was [chaired by Richard Dawkins](http://www.humanism.org.uk/news/view/246). Here’s a fuzzy iPhone picture of the Q&amp;A session at the end. (If only I’d brought my [50D](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/canon-eos-50d.html)!)

It was a fascinating talk about how successful languages and religions evolve over time. He covered a lot of ground in an engaging, entertaining and witty manner. Great stuff. What better way to show my atheist pride?
