I’ve not gone out and taken pictures specifically for PhotoFriday for a while, but this week I made an exception. This weeks theme is “[Electricity](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000767.php)” which is kind of tricky to photograph directly so I did the next best thing which is a [British](/tag/uk/) electric pylon.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/cold.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Cold](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=764).” I’m entry number 63.
