This weeks PhotoFriday, “[The Street](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001008.php),” was one where, unusually, I had quite a few options that I was happy with. In the end I figured that it had to be somewhere where pretty much all of life happens on the street. There were a few images taken in [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html) that came close, but I like this one in [Havana, Cuba](/travel/cuba.html), because everyone was completely oblivious to my presence; life goes on even when there are nosey tourists with cameras.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/photoshop-skills.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Photoshop Skills](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1006).” I’m entry number 167.
