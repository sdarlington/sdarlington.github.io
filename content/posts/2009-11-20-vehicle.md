My entry for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Vehicle](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000931.php),” was partly inspired by a conversation last weekend about the [highlights of Norway](/travel/norway.html). This is the train — vehicle — that takes you on the [Flåm railway](http://www.flaamsbana.no/eng/), twisting and turning down the side of Sognefjord from the top to the water front.
