There seem to have been a few food-related themes recently, and this week is no exception. The image above represents the PhotoFriday challenge “[Edible](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000860.php).” It’s [B](http://www.brandarling.com/) digging into some more than merely edible food in [Lisbon](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lisbon-portugal.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-weekend.html) in last weeks challenge, “[The Weekend](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=858).” I’m entry number 187.
