I went to see “[An Inconvenient Truth](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/ "An Inconvenient Truth")” last night, a film about [Al Gore’s global warming lecture tour](http://www.aninconvenienttruth.co.uk/ "An Inconvenient Truth").

It’s very well done. Gore delivers the talks with humour — he introduces himself link this, “I’m Al Gore, I used to be the next president of the United States” — confidence and passion. (If he’d had this passion in the presidential campaign things could have been very different!) Even for someone that agrees with the message there are some scary statistics. Perhaps even more scary is the lengths that some politicians go to to avoid acknowledging the problem, much less doing something about it.

Quite possibly a case of preaching to the choir, but I still think it’s well worth seeing.

As a counterpoint, you might want to look at [these videos from the Competitive Enterprise Institute](http://www.cei.org/pages/co2.cfm "Competitive Enterprise Institute videos"). Talking about CO2, “they call is pollution, we call it life.” Based on the fact that we breath out carbon dioxide they conclude that the volumes found in the air currently are perfectly natural.

These people should be forced to watch “An Inconvenient Truth.”
