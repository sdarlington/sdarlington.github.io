My challenge for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Primary Colour](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001079.php),” was that the picture I really wanted to use has been used at [least once already](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/vivid.html). The appeal with that one is that it has all three primary colours rather than just the two that you can see in the above picture, taken recently in Symi (a Greek island near to Rhodes). But, as they say, two out of three ain’t bad.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/minimalist.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Minimalist](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1077).” I’m entry number 199.
