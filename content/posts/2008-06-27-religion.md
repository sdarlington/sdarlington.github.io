Religion seems to be woven into the daily life of [Tibetans](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/tibet.html) in a way that seems alien to most Westerners, which made it a mine of possibilities for [this weeks PhotoFriday theme](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000785.php).

In the end I settled on this image from [Tashilumpo Monastery](http://www.insecula.com/us/musee/M0254.html), one of my favourites from that trip.
