Last night we went to the Royal Albert Hall to see the [Secret Policeman’s Ball](http://www.amnesty.org.uk/secretpolice/ "Amnesty International?s Secret Policeman?s Ball"), a charity gala in aid of Amnesty International. Despite the great cast — everyone from The Mighty Boosh to Eddie Izzard — beforehand I was worried that the “charity” aspect would take too prominent a position compared with the comedy. Obviously there’s a need to make people remember what the show is all about but often these events become preachy and, ultimately, a little dull.

I need not have worried. There were a few “cut sequences” as they re-arranged the stage, but even they provided laughs. (I particularly liked the [QVC-style advert for the AK-47](http://www.protectthehuman.com/teleshop/guns/ "Amnesty video").)

There were many memorable moments so it’s certainly worth watching when it comes [on TV in a few weeks](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/S/secret_policeman/). Personally I liked the sign interpretation of Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn” and Eddie Izzard’s demolition of so-called [Intelligent Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design "ID: creationism with a new PR sheen").
