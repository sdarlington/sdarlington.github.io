This weeks PhotoFriday, “[Nature](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000957.php),” is a much broader theme than we’ve had in the last few weeks. So lots of choices this time — too many — and in the end I figured that showing the vastness of a natural area, barely touched by man was the way to go. This image is originally from my [tribute to Ansel Adams](/photography/my-ansel-adams-tribute.html).
