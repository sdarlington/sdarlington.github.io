It seemed to take pretty much everyone by surprise. Techie-oriented website Slashdot greeted the introduction of the [iPod](http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod/ "Apple iPod") with the words: “[No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame.](http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/23/1816257&tid=107 "Slashdot's take on the iPod")” Even I, on the way home from Tottenham Court Road with a first generation, 5Gb model, thought, “What have I done? I’ve just paid ?350 for a walkman!” And I did wonder about the name.

But we all underestimated Apple. Five years later and now it’s difficult to see someone on the London Underground *without* an iPod and they’ve captured the public imagination in a way that few products have in recent times.[](http://news.com.com/2300-1041_3-6127599-1.html?part=rss&tag=6127599&subj=news)

I still think it’s one of the best gadgets I’ve ever bought. It’s amazing that they got so much right on that very first model.
