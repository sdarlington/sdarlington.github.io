This is about as “[Near](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001117.php)” — this weeks PhotoFriday theme — as I really want to get to a crocodile. Or alligator. Which ever this one is. It was in a farm, behind a fence, in Vietnam but still looked like a formidable creature.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Cars](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1115).” I’m number 193.
