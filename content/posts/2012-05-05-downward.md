[![View from the Eiffel Tower](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4094/4871613963_2d653acd16.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4871613963/ "View from the Eiffel Tower by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I don’t “get” many of the current entries to this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Downward](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001184.php),” so I thought I’d go for a very simple, very obvious interpretation of the theme. This is a view from the Eiffel Tower, looking *downwards* at the road below.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/portraiture.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Portraiture](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1182).” I’m entry number 147.
