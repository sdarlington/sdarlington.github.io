As today is Independence Day in the US, there has been a lot of introspection on the state of the country in much of the press.

“[To hate America is to hate mankind](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2006/07/03/dl0301.xml)” is the UK-based Telegraph’s take on things. It investigates the results of a recent survey which concluded that “many Britons regard America as malign, although they remain fond of individual Americans.” (I’m anti-Dubya but married a Californian so I think it’s fair to say that I agree with that!)

“[We Need Fewer Secrets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/02/AR2006070200674.html)” talks about the “Freedom of Information Act” and compares its efficiency with some of those countries that the US is trying to impose its values on.
