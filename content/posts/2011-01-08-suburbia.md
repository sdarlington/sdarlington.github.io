I’m slightly ahead of schedule for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge. Of course you could argue that I’m a day behind the *Friday* in the title, but it’s still a day ahead of my usual entry… This week the theme is “[Suburbia](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001047.php)” and the above image is looking over the part of the world where I was brought up. It’s Ossett in Yorkshire.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/best-of-2010.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Best of 2010](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1045).” I’m entry number 120.
