Where were you on the evening of 23rd April? We were in a rather damp and over-cast looking Trafalgar Square clicking together two halves of a coconut in an attempt to break a world record. The record?

“[The worlds largest coconut orchestra](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6586187.stm "The BBC's take on events").”

Very silly. And a lot of fun.

(By the way, the title is in reference to the TV series [Record Breakers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-nireland/A794775). Apparently it was the 65th Greatest Children’s TV Programme.)
