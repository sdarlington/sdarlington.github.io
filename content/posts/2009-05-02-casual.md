For this weeks challenge I was very tempted to use a picture of a woman sleeping in a Vietnamese market, as that’s perhaps the most relaxed and unconcerned person I’ve ever photographed. Then I realised that I’ve used it not [once](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/relaxation.html) but [twice](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/fresh.html) before. I like it, but three times seemed a little excessive.

Instead find above this chap sat in the walls at [Alexandria’s Qaitbay Citadel](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/egypt-alexandria.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/brown.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Brown](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=870).” I’m entry number 163.
