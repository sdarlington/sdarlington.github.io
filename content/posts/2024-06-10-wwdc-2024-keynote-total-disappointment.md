Expectations were low. No new hardware they said. New software they said. And yet, even with expectations so low, they failed.

What did we get? In short, nothing that we’ve not already seen from Google or Amazon or Microsoft. Sure, they did it with a bit of flair but, as we know, marketing is all that Apple are about these days. As Schiller said only three years ago, “\[Apple\] [can’t innovate anymore](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple).”

As has always been inevitable, Apple is doomed.

But you knew that. Which is why I felt that it was safe to write this piece five hours before the keynote started. Why let facts get in the way of dismissing them?
