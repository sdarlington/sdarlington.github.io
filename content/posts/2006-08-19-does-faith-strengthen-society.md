I found this interesting article that “[demolishe\[s\] the myth that faith strengthens society](http://www.humaniststudies.org/enews/index.html?id=219&article=7).”

While we’re frequently told that religion provides a moral basis for a civillised society, the study found “that secular societies have lower rates of violence and teenage pregnancy than societies where many people profess belief in God.”

How can that be?

> “Consciously or subconsciously, those who are “born again” or “chosen” have diminished respect for others who do not share their sect or their faith. Convinced that only the Bible offers “truth”, they lose their intellectual curiosity and their ability to reason. Their priority becomes not the world they live in but themselves.”

Of course it’s only anecdotal, but some of the “logical” reasoning I’ve heard supports that!
