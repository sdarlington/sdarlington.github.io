Last week [I complained that my iPhoneâ€™s camera was no substitute for my 50D](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/at-times-like-these.html).

The next day I was lucky enough to have my DSLR with me at sunset, and it looked a bit like this.

The following day I was in the neighbouring town of Competa and managed to capture these beautiful colours.

The church also looked fantastic bathed in the evening light.

I'll be posting some more pictures taken earlier in the day over the next week or two. Stay tuned!
