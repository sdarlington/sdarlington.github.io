[![The meeting of the North American and the European tectonic plates at Thingvellir, Iceland](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4102/4872212378_96f139140f.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4872212378/ "The meeting of the North American and the European tectonic plates at Thingvellir, Iceland by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Even in December, with the fog, rain and setting sun, this view of the meeting of the European and North American tectonic plates in [Iceland](/travel/iceland.html) is pretty spectacular. Breathtaking you might say. And, for the sake of [this weeks PhotoFriday challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001057.php), that’s exactly what I’m saying.

I didn’t make an entry in last weeks challenge so don’t feel obligated to vote for me!
