- [Why Norwegian is the easiest language for English speakers to learn](http://mithridates.blogspot.com/2008/08/why-norwegian-is-easiest-language-for.html) – I would have loved to have learned more of the language when I was there. The natives fluency in English really didn't help!
- [Did we say you can read that?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/15/nott_uni_update/) – "What the Police appear to be saying is that you can be given the all-clear as a bona fide researcher of terror material in the morning – then re-arrested the same evening for the same offence." And not only that, but you need to prove your own innocence. This is wrong on so many levels.
- [Eight ways the iMac changed computing](http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html?lsrc=rss_main) – I never owned one of the original iMacs (indeed, before OS X I was never likely to buy a Mac) but this was the beginning of the new Apple, one that resulted in me buying three Macs and various other Apple products. My bank account would probably have been more healthy without it!
