Did you notice the new little box on the left side of the screen? It’s from a new [Amnesty International](http://www.amnesty.org.uk/ "Amnesty International") campaign all about freedom of expression especially on the Internet. They call it [Irrepressible](http://irrepressible.info/ "Irrepressible"). I’m happy to do my small bit to help undermine censorship by publishing fragments of censored text, and I also signed the pledge. I urge you to do the same.
