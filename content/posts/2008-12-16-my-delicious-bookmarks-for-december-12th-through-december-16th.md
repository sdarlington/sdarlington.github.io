- [Are iPhone users just tight?](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/15/iphone_cheapskates/) – "Right now the iTunes Application Store is no more than an online Poundshop: customers will come in, take a look around and maybe even buy some tat they didn't know they wanted, but if the iPhone is going to be taken seriously then the boys from Cupertino are going to have to find a way to make users come to the store looking for something, and go away satisfied having spent more than a dollar."
- [WordPress 2.7 “Coltrane”](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/12/coltrane/) – Yet another update to WordPress, the software I use to power ZX81.org.uk. Quite a big change so it's possible that something has broken. Please let me know if you find anything.
