I had a hard time coming up with biggest, most metally thing I could think of. In the end I decided on the Golden Gate Bridge in [San Francisco](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/san-francisco.html), [California](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/california-2006.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/high-speed.html) in last weeks challenge, “[High Speed](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=880).” I’m entry number 19.
