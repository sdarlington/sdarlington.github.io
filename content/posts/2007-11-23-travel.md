Last weeks PhotoFriday theme was “[Travel](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=720).” If you’re observant you’ll notice that I didn’t make an entry despite most photography on my site being travel related and that’s because… I was travelling at the time!

In the next few days (maybe weeks depending on how busy I am!) you’ll be seeing some of my experiences in Jordan and Egypt. Keep your RSS reader primed…
