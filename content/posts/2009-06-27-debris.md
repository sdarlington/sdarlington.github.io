This weeks challenge, [Debris](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000888.php), was quite a hard one and I’m not entirely happy with my entry. It’s debris produced by some household refurbishment, taken on my iPhone and tweaked in PhotoShop.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/noisy.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Noisy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=886).” I’m entry number 142.
