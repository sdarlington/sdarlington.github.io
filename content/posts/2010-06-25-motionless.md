I can’t remember if I’ve used this picture for PhotoFriday before, but the cool stillness seemed to convey the theme of “[Motionless](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000993.php)” quite nicely. The fact that it’s a favourite image of mine — it’s on my living room wall — also helped of course! It was taken in [Fethiye, Turkey](/travel/turkey.html).

I haven’t taken part in PhotoFriday for the last few weeks so there’s no need to rush to vote for my previous entry (but thanks for your support).
