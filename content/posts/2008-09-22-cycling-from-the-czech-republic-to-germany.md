[![Cycling from Prague to Meißen](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6782218740_bacaa8a07a.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/6782218740/ "Cycling from Prague to MeiÃen by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I’ve noticed a trend. Every time that I come back from travelling and write a blog about it I start with the words “only a fool would…” Spend a whole winter in [Norway](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/norway.html)? Check. [Three countries](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/hungary.html) in one weekend? Count me in! Christmas in [Iceland](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/iceland.html)? Absolutely.

This time it was cycling from Prague to Meißen, nearly 230km or around 45km a day. If you get on your bike regularly that might not sound like much, but I’m what you’d call a fair weather cyclist. And the weather in the UK this summer has been neither fair nor summery. So as I sat on the plane at Heathrow I was both nervous and excited. I would get to see a lot of great towns and scenery en route, but I’d have to work for it.

I’m going to cover what I saw (and how I coped) over the next few days. Come back to see:

- [Prague](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/prague-czech-republic.html) (Czech Republic)
- [Prague to Melnik](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-in-czech-republic-prague-to-melnik.html) (Czech Republic)
- [Melnik to Litoměřice](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-in-czech-republic-melnik-to-litomerice.html) (Czech Republic)
- [Litoměřice to Děčín](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-in-czech-republic-litomerice-to-decin.html) (Czech Republic)
- [Děčín to Pirna](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-from-czech-republic-to-germany-decin-to-pirna.html) (crossing the border from Czech Republic into Germany)
- [Pirna to Meißen](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cycling-germany-pirna-to-meissen.html) (Germany)
