[![Snow, Tahoe Meadows](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7005/6736573209_82cddda2cc.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/6736573209/ "Snow, Tahoe Meadows by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Pristine](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001154.php),” is a word that I always associate with clean, white, untouched snow. I’ve only ever been skiing once and, since I spent most of my time falling down, I didn’t have my camera with me very much. So instead, I have the above image, taken near [Lake Tahoe](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lake-tahoe.html). The snow, despite it being July, is still pretty much untouched.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/cloudy.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Cloudy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1152).” I’m entry number 206.
