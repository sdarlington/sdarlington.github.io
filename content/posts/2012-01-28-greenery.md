This weeks PhotoFriday is “[Greenery](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001156.php).” Maybe it’s too obvious, but my first thoughts were about green, verdant forests with bubbling streams and soft light. I have a few of those in my library but in the end went with this one taken in [Kamikochi, Japan](/travel/japan-kamikochi.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/pristine.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Pristine](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1154).” I’m entry number 132.
