After exceeding my goal of [twelve books](/posts/2024-01-05-reading-2023/) last year, I went in completely the other direction in 2024 with [only five books completed](/tags/reading2024).

I did, however, read an unusual mix by my standards. Only two of the books were non-fiction. So, even with the smaller number, I still managed to read more novels than I normally do. And the standard was high, too. I don't think any of them were _classics_ but I enjoyed them all. Not  bad result!

Ever the glutton for pain, I'm going to go for the twelve book goal again for 2025. Wish me luck; I'm going to need it!
