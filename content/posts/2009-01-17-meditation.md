A Tibetan monk spends a lot of his time meditating. Unfortunately I didn’t get a good picture of one so this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Meditation](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000842.php),” is a picture of the many people who meditate, pray and prostrate outside the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, [Tibet](/travel/tibet.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/white.html) in last weeks challenge, “[White](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=840).” I’m entry 266.
