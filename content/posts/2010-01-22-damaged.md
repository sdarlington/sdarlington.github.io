I saw this car a few weeks ago and thought that the crumpled headlight was interesting. I went back a day or so later and took a few pictures. I thought this might make a good entry for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Damaged](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000949.php).”

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Slowly](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=946).” I’m entry number 181.
