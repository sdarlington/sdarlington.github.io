This is another image taken on my recent trip to [Stockholm](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/stockholm-sweden.html). I have a fascination for doors and windows, especially when they contrast with the sky. In Sweden we were lucky to have bright, blue skies most of the time (don’t get too jealous, it was below ten degrees mostly). Combine this with a polarising filter and the right time of day and you get this really neat contrast between the roof and the sky.

I had a similar idea with this photograph. The contrast isn’t quite as great but the roof has more detail so it still sort of works.
