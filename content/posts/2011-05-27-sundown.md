This kind of feels wrong. Posting my PhotoFriday entry, this week for the theme “[Sundown](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001087.php),” actually on a Friday is very much out of character for me. As an added bonus, I really like this image. It was taken in [Kyoto](/travel/japan-kyoto.html), Japan last year.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/many.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Many](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1085)” (quite by chance, it was also taken in Japan). I’m entry number 177.
