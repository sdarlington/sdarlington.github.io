This weeks PhotoFriday challenge is “[Lines](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001075.php).” I have a lot of pictures that have lines in them but fairly few where it’s the most prominent feature. My first choice of image was of my old, broken MacBook hard-disk but then I realised that I had already used it for a PhotoFriday last year! So I switched to the above picture, taken in the [Tokyo](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/japan-tokyo.html) Forum.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/ride.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Ride](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1073).” I’m entry number 155.
