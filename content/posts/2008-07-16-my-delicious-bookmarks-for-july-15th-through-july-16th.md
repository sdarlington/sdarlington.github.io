- [Ars Book Review: "Patent Failure"](http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/book-review-7-08.ars) – Interesting book review about the effect of patents on an industry. Apparently cost more money than they make in anything but chemical and pharmaceuticals.
- [Lucky to be a Programmer](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/lucky-to-be-a-programmer) – I don't program as much as I used to but this explains why I love to when I get the chance.
- [WordPress 2.6](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/) – Usual drill. I've upgraded to the latest version of WordPress, the underlying software of ZX81.org.uk. If you see anything wrong please let me know!
- [20 Amazing Facts About Voting in the USA](http://nightweed.com/printableusavotefacts.html) – Still in any doubt that computerised voting machines are a bad idea for free and fair elections?
