[![Trip in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5471/10817574574_5f4d23c2e8.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817574574 "Trip in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam by Stephen Darlington, on Flickr")

Of course, the person in this boat on Ha Long Bay is far from alone, which means I’m very much faking this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Solitude](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1415).” But he *looks* alone and the landscape is empty and beautiful so I think it fits the bill!

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Black and White](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1413).” I’m entry number 48.
