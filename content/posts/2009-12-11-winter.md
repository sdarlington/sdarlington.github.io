I always associate snow with “[Winter](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000937.php)“, this weeks PhotoFriday theme, so the above was an obvious candidate for my entry. It was taken not far from home in some of the worst weather we’ve had in the UK for a good few years.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/homemade.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Homemade](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=935).” I’m entry number 158.
