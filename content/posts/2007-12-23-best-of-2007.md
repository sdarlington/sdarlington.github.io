This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Best of 2007](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000730.php).” This is my entry.

This is what I consider to be my best picture of 2007 ((Currently. It changes on an hour-by-hour basis but I’ll not change this picture now that I’ve posted it.)) which, of course, isn’t *exactly* what the theme suggests. It was taken in [Wadi Rum, Jordan](/travel/jordan-wadi-rum.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Sunrise](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=728).” I’m entry number 59.
