- [Ofcom considers termination charges](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/29/ofcom_mobile_assessment/) – Does anyone consider it a problem that we don't get charged to receive calls on a mobile phone in the UK? Thought not.
- [Man's 'pants' password is changed](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/shropshire/7585098.stm) – Not sure what to conclude from this other than it's funny. Banks have no sense of humour? Don't bank with Lloyds?
- [US made to wait for Quantum of Solace](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/22/bond_release_date/) – I would like to see the release of QoS pushed out by six months in the US as revenge for making us wait that long for Ratatouille last year. Not that I'm bitter or anything.
