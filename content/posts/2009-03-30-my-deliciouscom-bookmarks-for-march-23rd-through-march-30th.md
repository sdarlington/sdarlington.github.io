- [A thought experiment](http://furbo.org/2009/03/29/a-thought-experiment/) – "This presents a problem for customers who are still running the 2.2.1 firmware: they can’t get your fix until they upgrade to the 3.0 firmware."
- [U.S. support for Detroit would buy 50 million Tata Nanos](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/03/27/us-support-for-detroit-would-buy-50-million-tato-nanos-per-year/) – "What else might we do with $100 billion in this industry? Assuming that we could get a wholesale price of $2000 per car, that’s enough to buy 50 million four-passenger 54 mpg Tata Nanos. The fuel savings from driving Nanos to the 7-11 instead of monster SUVs would save taxpayers $100 billion every year."
- [Right to privacy broken by a quarter of UK's public databases, says report](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/mar/23/dna-database-idcards-children-index) – "The report, Database State by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, says that more than half of Whitehall's 46 databases and systems have significant problems with privacy or effectiveness, and could fall foul of a legal challenge." And people wonder why I'm against ID cards and internet snooping laws.
