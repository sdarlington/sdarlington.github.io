<span style="font-size: revert;">Following on from </span>[XKCD](https://xkcd.com)<span style="font-size: revert;">, “What if?,” and “How to” comes Randal Munroe’s “</span>[What if? 2](https://amzn.to/43cHs3j)<span style="font-size: revert;">.” It’s another collection of silly questions with scientific, humorous answers. Examples include “Could you eat a cloud?” and “How far could you see if you had an eye as big as the earth?”</span>

It’s as simple as this: if you liked those books, you’ll like this one.

> “Incineration of organic matter within it” is a bad feature for an umbrella.

If I have a criticism, it’s that it feels like it’s playing by numbers at this point. All the same ingredients are there. I did enjoy it — I genuinely laughed out loud at parts of it — but it’s not as fresh and original as, well, the original. Is this the fate of all sequels?
