[![Goat](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7395/11994615085_b7f7258d87.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11994615085/ "Goat by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

The first thing I thought of when I read this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “Wildlife,” was the African Savannah. The lions, gazelles, giraffes, all the famous big mammals. Unfortunately I’ve never been. So I’m afraid you’ll have to make do with this picture of a goat I took in [Corsica](/travel/corsica.html). The thing I like about it is the sad look in his eyes; he may not be wild but he wants to be.
