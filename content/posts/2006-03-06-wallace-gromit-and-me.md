Rather than just provide a link to the news that [Nick Park’s “Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit” won an Oscar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4777480.stm), I thought I’d also point you to an interview:

[NETRIBUTION – OSCAR WINNER NICK PARK — Wallace, Gromit and Me](http://www.netribution.co.uk/2/people/humble_being/oscar_contender_nick_park_--_wallace,_gromit_and_me.html)

The care and attention that goes into these films is, no doubt, exactly why they’re as good as they are.

On the other hand I have no idea why “[Crash](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/)” did so well. It wasn’t a bad movie by any means but I thought it lacked the cleverness and brilliance that characterised most reviews I saw of it.
