I was in a bit of a bind about this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[In Shadow](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000897.php).” I have lots of pictures *of* shadows but few that seemed to fit the brief. That’s to say, I’m not sure that this is the best picture but I do think it fits the theme better than most. Still, I do like the angle. It’s probably impossible to get an original take on the [Eiffel Tower](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/paris-2006.html) but this is the closest I got.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/my-favourite-spot.html) in last weeks challenge, “[My Favourite Spot](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=894).” I’m entry number 228.
