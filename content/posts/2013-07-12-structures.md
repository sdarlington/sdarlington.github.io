[![Oslo Opera House](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8017/7574198084_dc3d6781d6.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/7574198084/ "Oslo Opera House by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Yet another long gap between entries to PhotoFriday, but when I saw that the theme was “[Structures](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1306)” I immediately thought about, first, the [Sagrada Família](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/barcelona.html "Barcelona"). But I didn’t have any pictures of the outside that I liked so second thought was the [Oslo Opera House](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/oslo.html "Oslo"). I think this picture of the *inside* shows the structures better than any image of the outside.
