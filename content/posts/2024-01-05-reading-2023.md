In a turn of events that surprised even me, I managed to exceed [my reading target of twelve books this year](/tag/reading2023).

I managed a decent mix of fiction and non-fiction. More politics than usual, but even that was mostly on the lighter side.

Highlights would be “[Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes](/blog/jeremy-hardy-speaks-volumes.html)” and “[How Westminster Works](/blog/how-westminster-works-and-why-it-doesnt.html).” I don’t think any of the books were *bad* so I’m not going to share a “worst of.” You can see from the notes which ones I enjoyed the most.

I’m going to keep with the twelve book target for next year.
