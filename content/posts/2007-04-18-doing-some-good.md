Sometime when bad things happen all you can do it show your support. That’s what I’m doing here. The first cause is “One Day Blog Silence”:

This is to honour the victims from Virginia Tech and all those other innocents throughout the world. Given that the “blogosphere” is where many students poured their grief and vented their anger it seems appropriate.

On a smaller scale but just as disturbing is the abduction of BBC journalist Alan Johnston.

Again, there’s little I can do directly but show my support and add my name to the petition. If you have a web presence, please join in.
