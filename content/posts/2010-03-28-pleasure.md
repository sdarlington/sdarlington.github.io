How could you *not* take great “[Pleasure](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000967.php)” in devouring this apple strudel? It was both photographed and consumed — the sacrifices I make for a good picture — at the Hotel Sacher in [Vienna](/travel/vienna-austria.html). Sacher is more famous for its chocolate cake but I preferred this.
