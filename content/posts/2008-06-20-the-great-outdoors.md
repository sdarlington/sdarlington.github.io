[![Walk from Sermano to Corte, Corsica](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7319/11995409706_6b8da62f1c.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11995409706/ "Walk from Sermano to Corte, Corsica by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Like many people, I take the vast majority of my pictures outside. Yet, how do you get across [the greatness of outdoors](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000783.php)? I wanted the picture to show the scale and grandeur, the exhilaration of being in the middle of nowhere. It was a tall order so instead I picked this image which was taken on the [walk from Sermano to Corte](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/corsica-sermano-to-corte.html) in [Corsica](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/corsica.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Movement](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=781).” I’m entry 211.
