<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1061" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1061" style="width: 500px">![Cairo sunset, Egypt](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/img_4387.jpg?resize=500%2C333 "Cairo sunset, Egypt")<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1061">Cairo sunset, Egypt</figcaption></figure>

This slightly understated image, taken around [dusk](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000831.php), is one of my favourites from my trip to [Egypt](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html) last year. At first glance it’s just a sunset taken over a “generic” city, but a more comprehensive look reveals the pyramids, meaning that it must be [Cairo](/travel/egypt-cairo.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/black.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Black](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=829).” I’m entry number 226.
