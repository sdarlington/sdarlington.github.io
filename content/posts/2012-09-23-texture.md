It’s been a while since I entered a PhotoFriday challenge, but when I saw that this weeks was theme “[Texture](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001223.php)” I immediately thought of this picture. It was taken in [Spain](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/canillas-de-albaida-spain.html) in 2009 and has been the desktop picture on my Mac pretty much since then!
