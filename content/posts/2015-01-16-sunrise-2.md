This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Sunrise](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1468)” (the [second time](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/sunrise.html "Sunrise") this subject has been used!). This is one of an increasing number of decent pictures taken on my iPhone rather than my SLR.

I missed last weeks challenge, so no need to vote for me!
