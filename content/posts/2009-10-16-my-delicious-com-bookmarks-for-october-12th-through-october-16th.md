- [Palm Pre smartphone](http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/10/16/review_phone_palm_pre/) – "So you're after a smartphone, you've got money to burn and an obvious decision to make: this or the iPhone. No other touchscreen smartphone is even in the running. The Pre has some obvious advantages. It's a bit smaller than the iPhone and 'Synergy' works well, which could prove useful if you're more familiar with Facebook than the concept of Gmail or an Exchange server. But weigh it against the iPhone and it's hard to recommend."
- [The Hitchhiker’s Guide Turns 30](http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/10/the-hitchhikers-guide-turns-30/) – Still one of my favourite books.
- [Cat registered as hypnotherapist](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8303126.stm) – To be fair, cats do seem to convince people to pet them and feed them without any apparent pay-back. Maybe they do hypnotise them?
