I’ve lived in London for thirty years[^0]. Somehow. 

I’m not entirely sure how it happened. It was never _the plan_. Not that I had a plan. If you’d asked me where I wanted to live, I probably wouldn’t have picked London.

I applied to a handful of jobs at the tail-end of my stint at university[^0a]. The one job offer I received[^0b] was in London. That’s how it started.

To give you an idea of how arbitrary it all was: my first employer had offices in central London and in Surrey. I looked at the train lines and found that Wimbledon was about half way between the two. That’s where I ended up.

I didn’t have a plan much beyond that. If anyone had asked, I might have suggested staying for a year or two before heading back north.

Instead, I stayed.

A colleague recently asked why, and I’m not sure that I had a great answer. Sure, there’s an element of inertia and the complexity of uprooting the entire family. And undoubtedly there’s a degree of romanticism, the _idea_ of London rather than the reality[^1].

But there really is something of everything here. It’s one of the few, genuinely [“world” cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city). There are people, languages, culture and food from everywhere[^2]. Before remote work became feasible, it was the best place in the UK, probably all of Europe, to find the kind of work I’m qualified to do.

It’s expensive and busy and polluted, so there’s undoubtedly a cost. I know I’m fortunate and I’m not pretending it’s for everyone, but, consciously or not, it’s a trade-off that I’m still happy with.


[^0]: I don’t have a record of the exact date. I know my job started early October and I overly optimistically gave myself a couple of weeks to find somewhere to live.

[^0a]: Hubris in some aspects of my life has been a constant.

[^0b]: My hubris has not always been warranted.

[^1]: I remember when I first arrived here, Oxford Street was _amazing_. These days it seems more than a little stale and sad. Time and internet shopping have not been kind. 

[^2]: Like pretty much everyone that lives here, I don’t experience it as much as I would like. But it’s _right there_ and I love that.
