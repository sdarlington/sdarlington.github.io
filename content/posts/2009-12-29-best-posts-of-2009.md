It’s that time of year where all the papers, magazines and websites devolve into the best of the year articles rather than actually generate new content. I didn’t want to feel left out so here’s my contribution.

Of course “best” can mean any number of different things, so I’m going to pick a few top fives.

Here are the most popular pages viewed this year:

1. [Installing Oracle 10g Express Edition on CentOS 4](/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/installing-oracle-10g-express-edition-on-centos-4.html)
2. [Professionalism](/computing/opinion/professionalism.html)
3. [Oracle 8i for Linux Installation HOWTO](/computing/oracle/oracle-howto/howto.html)
4. [Minolta Dual Scan II](/computing/opinion/dualscanii.html)
5. [Review: Belkin Wi-Fi Phone](/computing/opinion/review-belkin-wi-fi-phone.html)

It continues to surprise me how popular the Oracle pages are. They are now very old products and the pages have not been updated for quite some time now.

And here are the most popular pages that were actually written this year:

1. [Professionalism](/computing/opinion/professionalism.html)
2. [Canon EOS 50D](/photography/canon-eos-50d.html)
3. [Bus Bench for Humans Only](/travel/bus-bench-for-humans-only.html)
4. [www.cut](/news/www-cut.html)
5. [Why would you want an ID card?](/blog/why-would-you-want-an-id-card.html)

Of course my personal favourites don’t always make the grade in terms of page views, so here are my choices (in no particular order this time):

- [Blackroom](/photography/blackroom.html)
- [Vienna](/travel/vienna-austria.html)
- [Three](/photography/photofriday/three.html)
- [Number One, The Larch](/photography/number-one-the-larch.html)
- [Contrast](/photography/contrast.html)
- [Icicles](/photography/icicles.html)

If there’s a theme here, it’s photography and the kinds of pictures that I don’t normally take.
