I always have immense difficulty choosing my next travel destination. The bottom line is that I’d happily visit almost anywhere I’ve not been before. And even then, many of the places I have been to I’d happily go back to. With around two hundred countries in the world this presents a problem. Then you need to combine this with the fact that I love reading about travel — books, brochures, back issues of [Wanderlust](/travel/wanderlust.html "My favourite travel magazine") — and you can easily believe that it can take me months to decide where to travel to next.

I know. I lead such a hard life.

Anyway, after a [relatively short holiday](/travel/iceland.html "Iceland pictures and commentery") last year, this year was going to be India. Except. Long story short: I did not have enough leave from work to be able to do everything I wanted.

Eventually, through a process of compromise and whittling down that I couldn’t explain even if I tried, I ended up deciding on the middle east in general and Jordan and Egypt in particular. I’ve had a mixed experience with the Middle East in the past. I loved [Turkey](/travel/turkey.html "My experience in Turkey") but wasn’t keen on [UAE](/travel/uae.html "Dubai and Abu Dhabi"). Fortunately both Jordan and Egypt promised more of the history and culture of the former and less of the shiny, characterless modernity of the Dubai I had seen.

As I have done for the last couple of trips, I felt it made most sense to break the holiday down into bite sized chunks. I am going to cover the sights in Jordan in the following posts:

- [Jerash](/travel/jordan-jerash.html)
- [Kerak](/travel/jordan-kerak.html)
- [Petra](/travel/jordan-petra.html)
- [Wadi Rum](/travel/jordan-wadi-rum.html)

And Egypt in these:
