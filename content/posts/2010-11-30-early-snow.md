It seems that the weather is not without a sense of irony ((Nod to The Matrix with that line of course.)). In the year that is the hottest on record, in the UK we’re having a very early cold snap, complete with snow.

I did think that it was all archive footage, since the papers were full of coverage yet there was no snow at all in London. And then this morning the pavements were covered. When I went out for a bite to eat at lunchtime I took my camera with me…

By early afternoon the snow was becoming quite heavy and was settling.

The park was mostly monochrome, with the grey sky and snow, but there was still the occasional splash of colour in the play ground…

…and in peoples shoes.

Unable to feel my toes and fully stocked with lunch and dinner, I went back home. I’ve not been out since. It’s warm here.
