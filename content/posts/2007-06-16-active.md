This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Active](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000676.php "PhotoFriday: Active").”

A protest (in [Bath, UK](/travel/bath-uk.html "Bath pictures and commentary")) may not seem very active, but one definition of it is: “doing things for an organization, cause, or campaign, rather than simply giving it one’s support : *she was an active member of the church | he had never been very **active in** the affairs of the institute | he enjoyed the active support of the government.*”
