I should probably apologise in advance for the puns.

This weeks PhotoFriday is “[Cleanliness](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000961.php).” I came up with a number of ideas, a few of which I tried, most of which didn’t work. Then I decided that the various liquids kept under the kitchen sink might be suitable since they tend to be used to keep things clean. While fairly colourful it wasn’t quite enough. It needed something else.

One of the phrases I’d been thinking of was “Cleanliness is next to godliness.” Ours is not the kind of household to have a copy of the Bible or Qur’an to hand so I had to improvise. This may require changing the phrase to “Cleanliness is next to godlessness” but it works. Kind of.

I didn’t have an entry in last weeks PhotoFriday so there’s no need to feel guilty for not voting for me.
