With my camera still primed and ready after my [weekend PhotoFriday activity](/photography/photofriday/electricity.html), I just had to take a few shots of this rainbow as seen from our flat. Rainbows are pretty much the only up-side I can see of the nasty weather weâ€™ve been having for most of the last couple of weeks!
