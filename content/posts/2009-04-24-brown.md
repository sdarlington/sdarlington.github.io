A lot of things are “[Brown](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000870.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday Challenge, but I rarely label things by their colour so it was difficult to find them in iPhoto! In the end I went for these trees in [Muir Woods](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/muir-woods.html), California.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/circular.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Circular](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=868).” I’m entry number 43.
