Seemingly lacking anything much in common with humans, jellyfish are often considered to be primitive forms of life. I think that makes this picture appropriate for this weeks [PhotoFriday challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000726.php), even though [new information](http://community.livejournal.com/scyphistoma/4399.html) indications that they are much more evolved that we previously thought.

This image was taken in [Monterey Bay Aquarium](/travel/monterey-bay-aquarium.html) in California.
