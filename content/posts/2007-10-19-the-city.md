This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[The City](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000712.php "PhotoFriday: The City").” Here is my entry.

I kind of *had* to do this one of [San Francisco](/travel/san-francisco.html "San Francisco pictures") as they call it “The City.” [Eddie Izzard explains](http://www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath/d2ktranscription.html#thegreatescape "The City"):

> Oakland, San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay! You?re not called West Bay, are you? No, you?re just (mockingly ) “The City.”
> 
> “Are you going to ‘The City’ today?
> 
> “I might go to ‘The City.'”
> 
> And Oakland is just a collection of houses, is it?
