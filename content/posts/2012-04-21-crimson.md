[![Sunset in Malta](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7098/7099355777_7f88698186.jpg?resize=500%2C342)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/7099355777/ "Sunset in Malta by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I’m not sure whether a “[Crimson](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001180.php)” sunset is too obvious an interpretation of the theme, but I couldn’t find a better image so you’re stuck with this one(!).

It was taken in [Malta](/travel/misc2003.html), just outside where I was staying in St Julians. The picture was taken on… gasp… actual film.
