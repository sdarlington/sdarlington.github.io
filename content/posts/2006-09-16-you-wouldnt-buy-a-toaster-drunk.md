Last night we went to see [Dylan Moran](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/dylan_moran.shtml "Dylan Moran profile") do stand-up comedy at the Hammersmith Apollo here in London.

Here in the UK he is probably most famous for his role in the sit-com [Black Books](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0262150/ "Black Books") where he plays, well, pretty much himself it turns out. It’s a version of Moran who works in a book store with Manny (Bill Bailey).

It’s difficult to say much about his show as he doesn’t really tell jokes as such, more a stream of observations. A couple of years ago when I first saw him live his most memorable line was “Children are just small drunks.” This time it was about relationships: “The first time you meet your partner you are generally drunk. Why would you do that? You wouldn’t buy a toaster drunk. It’s too important a decision.”

We were impressed. If you get the chance, he’s well worth seeing.
