[![June in London.](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/5839357578_431a77270e.jpg?resize=500%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5839357578/ "June in London. by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

As soon as I saw the theme for this weeks challenge, “[Gloomy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001099.php),” I knew which image I needed to use. I took it only a couple of weeks ago on the way to work and is a great representation of the kind of summer we’ve been having so far. Pretty gloomy, eh?

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/sharp-focus.html#respond) in last weeks challenge, “[Sharp Focus](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1097).” I’m entry 151.
