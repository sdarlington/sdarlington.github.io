I was so busy when it came out that I never quite got around to blogging about it here: I have a new app out! It’s called [ShareEverywhere](http://www.wandlesoftware.com/products/shareeverywhere). It is built exclusively for iOS 8 and uses the new, built-in “share” functionality, allowing you to share to a good number of services from any app that uses the standard share button.

When I first wrote it, I wasn’t sure how many, if any, developers would build share widgets into their apps. Now that we know the answer is “a lot of them,” I still use ShareEverywhere because it beats having a dozen widgets hiding in your action menu. And there are still services, like Pinboard.in, that don’t have their own native apps.

It’s available [now in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shareeverywhere/id907852534?ls=1&mt=8&at=11lmMT&ct=zx81) for your iPhone or iPad. It costs £1.49, $1.99, €1.79 or your local equivalent.
