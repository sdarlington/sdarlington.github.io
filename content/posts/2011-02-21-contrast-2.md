[For this weeks PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001059.php), I thought of a picture I took a couple of years ago in Stockholm. As I usually do, I searched to see if I’d used the same image for any other challenges. It turns out I had. For a challenge titled, “[Contrast](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/contrast.html).” Well, at least I’m consistent.

The above image, of the Getty Museum in [Los Angeles](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/los-angeles.html), has pretty much the same idea.

I’m even later than usual this week — I was away from home is my excuse — so even though [I posted an entry in last weeks challenge](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/breathtaking.html), it’s now too late to vote for it. Even I didn’t vote for myself!
