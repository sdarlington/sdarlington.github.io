In the weakest possible sense of the word, these two images can be considered to be my tribute to Ansel Adams’ work in the [Sierra Nevada](/travel/yosemite.html).

While he had to [lug huge cameras around and work with large format film](http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/results.asp?keyword1=ansel+adams&search_type=advanced&sort_by=date&boolean_type1=and&boolean_type2=and) I merely had to carry around my [50D](/photography/canon-eos-50d.html)[^1] and play around in Photoshop Elements.

I find it a little odd that the thing that drew me to both of these pictures were the colours[^2] yet there is still enough texture and shape to make them work in black and white.
[^1]: Though many would complain about the size and weight of my DSLR!
[^2]: The top photograph can be found in colour in my [Yosemite post](/travel/yosemite.html). The other you’ll just have to imagine.
