Initially I thought that I was going to be staying in [Fiesole](http://www.fiesole.com/) for [the entire trip](/travel/tuscany-italy.html). The description of the villa and some of the directions mentioned it explicitly so before flying out I made some effort to read up on the place. It turns out that it’s actually *older* than the now much larger city of Florence (Firenze). As such it has its own respectable church and some fairly extensive Etruscan ruins.

In the end the villa was actually nearer Santa Brigida but the reading was not wasted and I ended up visiting Fiesole on a couple of occasions.

It’s an attractive town. The main square would likely have been very pretty had it not been under construction, there’s a nice view of Florence (no picture as the only time I was there I didn’t get a picture) and the Etruscan ruins are extensive.

In the afternoon I was going to head down the hill into [Florence](/travel/florence-tuscany-italy.html) itself.
