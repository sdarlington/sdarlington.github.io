It all started <del datetime="2010-11-29T20:13:14+00:00">ten</del> thirteen years ago. In November 1998 I went with a friend to Amsterdam, and now every November since I have spent at least a few days out of the country.

For the record, those trips were:

- Amsterdam, The Netherlands (1998)
- [Abu Dhabi, UAE](/travel/uae.html) (1999)
- [Thailand](/travel/thailand.html) (2000)
- [Oslo, Norway](/travel/norway.html) (2001)
- [Malta](/travel/misc2003.html) (2002)
- [Charlotte, NC, USA](/travel/misc2003.html) (2003)
- [Cuba](/travel/cuba.html) (2004)
- [Brussels](/travel/belgium-2005.html), Belgium (2005)
- [Lille](/travel/lille-2006.html), France (2006)
- [Jordan and Egypt](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html) (2007)
- [Lisbon](/travel/lisbon-portugal.html), Portugal (2008)
- [Vienna](/travel/vienna-austria.html), Austria (2009)
- [Amsterdam and Den Haag](/travel/the-netherlands.html), The Netherlands (2010)

It never started as a challenge and you can’t deliberately start a tradition, but I’m keen to keep this one going for as long as I can. Even if it is a little silly.
