- [Aerial views of New York](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2010/sep/21/aerial-views-of-new-york#/?picture=366876675&index=0) – Neat pictures of Manhattan (and bits of New Jersey).
- [Wallace and Gromit to appear on Christmas stamps](http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/sep/21/wallace-gromit-christmas-stamps) – For once: Christmas stamps that I approve of.
- [My First Week with the iPhone](http://behindthecurtain.us/2010/06/12/my-first-week-with-the-iphone/) – I always assumed that a touch device like the iPhone would be pretty much useless for blind users. It's good to be wrong.
