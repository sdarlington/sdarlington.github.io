I thought that this image of some slide film would be appropriate for PhotoFriday this week. It works (to my mind) for two reasons. First, the theme is “[Round](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001012.php)” and the shape of the film canister is, well, round. Secondly, Fuji Sensia is in the news as [it has been discontinued](http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1727476/fuji-sensia-rip). It’s quite sad news. In the days before I went digital it’s the film that used the most.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/warm.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Warm](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1010).” I’m entry number 195.
