[![Floppy disk](https://i0.wp.com/farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5990619462_83de68e2d6.jpg?resize=500%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5990619462/ "Floppy disk by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Enormous](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001105.php),” which is kind of a difficult word to get across. A lot of people have just gone for big things or small things at high magnifications. I thought I’d go for a 3.5″ floppy disk, as I remember 1.44Mb being *enormous*, way more than anyone could reasonably use — and far more than the 100K per side that my BBC Micro managed on its 5.25″ disks. Of course, a single raw image from my 50D would need fourteen of them…

There’s no need to rush to vote for my entry in last weeks challenge as I didn’t post an entry.
