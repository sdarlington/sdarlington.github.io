I was sad to see the passing of Linda Smith. I never saw any of her stand up work but I heard her frequently on [Just a Minute](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/justaminute.shtml) and [The News Quiz](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/newsquiz.shtml), where she was always sharp and funny.

Jeremy Hardy called her “the wittiest and brightest person working on TV or radio panel games” which really isn’t very far from the mark.
