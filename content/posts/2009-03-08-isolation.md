This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Isolation](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000856.php).” It was tempting to use an image in the [Himalayas](/travel/tibet.html) or an empty snowscape in [Norway](/travel/norway.html), but I figured being alone and isolated in a crowd was worse. Okay, so this chap isn’t in a crowd but he *is* in the biggest city in [Portugal](/travel/lisbon-portugal.html) and he is isolated, alone in his thoughts.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/city-life.html) in last weeks challenge, “[City Life](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=854).” My entry is number 209.
