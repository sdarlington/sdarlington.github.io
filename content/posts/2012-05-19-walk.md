I’ve just been away for a week walking in the Lake District, so “[Walk](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001188.php)” *should* be the ideal PhotoFriday theme for me. Unfortunately I forgot my USB cable and can’t download my photographs. Instead, this is a picture from a walking holiday a couple of years ago in the south of [Spain](/travel/canillas-de-albaida-spain.html).

Please also vote for my picture in last weeks challenge, “[Detailed](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1186).” I’m entry number 101.
