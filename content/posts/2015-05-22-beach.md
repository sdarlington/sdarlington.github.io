For this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Beach](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1504),” I went all the way back to my first visit to [San Francisco](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/california-2006.html), with this image of Baker Beach. You can see the famous Bay Area fog and — if you expect all of California to be as warm as LA — lots of overdressed people.

Please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Reflections](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1502).” I’m entry number 81.
