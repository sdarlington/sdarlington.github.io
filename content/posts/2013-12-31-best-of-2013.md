It’s always hard to pick the best picture for a whole year (“[Best of 2013](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1357)“). How can a single image capture the whole year?

*Really* I would have to include a picture of my son, as much of the year feels like it’s been chasing after him, trying to stop him fearlessly leaping off tall and dangerous things. But I didn’t feel that any single image captured that.

Instead, this is a quick snapshot taken on my iPhone on the way to work one day. It’s amazing both how far cameras on phones have come in the last fews years (and this isn’t even the latest or greatest any more) and how a bit of luck can have great results.
