*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

Sadly, another one of those “what happened to the author” books. As much as I don’t want to be a gatekeeper, Dawkins might well have been better sticking to evolution rather than branch out into religion and trans issues (the former in which he’s forthright but not original and the latter [where he’s just wrong](https://www.thepinknews.com/2021/11/01/richard-dawkins-trans-women-race-gender/)).

But whatever happened since, “[The Selfish Gene](https://amzn.to/3NoKXy8)” \[affiliate link\] itself is a classic. It’s where the word “meme” came from, and memes are everywhere these days! It’s well written and makes a difficult subject understandable. It refined my thinking about evolution, the scientific process and science writing in general.
