After all my fun with [Couch to 5K](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/c25k-diary.html) and the [Parkrun](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/c25k-diary-part-4.html), [The Incomplete Book of Running](https://amzn.to/2HI7Vjd), about Peter Sagal‘s running experiences, looked like it might strike a chord.

One thing that *didn’t* strike a chord was the author. I guess if you’re American and listen to NPR and [*Wait wait… don’t tell me!*](https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/) you might know what you’re letting yourself in for. But I’m British and am more likely to be listening to [*The News Quiz on Radio 4*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9yq). I don’t think that this missing knowledge affected my enjoyment of the book, though.

Anyway, *his* experience didn’t exactly mirror mine. He’d flirted with running earlier in life and got into running longer distances later. The book starts with him running the Boston marathon. I’m still at the point where 5km feels like a long distance and I barely did any exercise beyond walking previously. Still, there were enough parallels that I didn’t feel lost and the writing was easy and accessible.

It’s more about stories and anecdotes than running hints and tips, but it still covers a lot of ground, from training to motivation to the benefits and downsides.

There were certainly some bit where I wasn’t entirely sure if it was funny or just, sadly, true:

> The problem with being a midlife-crisis runner is that once you start, you’re already in decline.

Then, towards the end, was this important passage:

> The differences between running as a lifestyle and “jogging” as exercise are many and much debated, but the key one is this: You “jog” as necessary exercise, something to endure. You run with the expectation that this outing, today, will be the day when it all comes together.

I’ve not really thought about it before, but I’ve never been quite sure how to describe what I do. “Running” feels optimistic; the speed I go is hardly *running*. Then again, “jogging” conjures up some of the worst stereotypes, the bright Lycra, the headband.

That paragraph seals the deal: I run. I *do* do it for exercise, but I wouldn’t say that I *endure* it. If it wasn’t fun — or at least give a sense of achievement after I finish — I wouldn’t do it, I’d find some other form of exercise.

Overall, it’s hardly essential reading but if you like him from his radio programmes, you might get a kick out this book. For me, it was worth it as a way of figuring out my vocabulary.
