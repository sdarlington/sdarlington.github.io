Some would say that it can only mean that I have far too much time on my hands. I claim that I’m merely interested. As is often the case, the truth maybe somewhere between the two. But the fact is, I do like to keep an eye how many people are visting ZX81.org.uk and what they’re looking at.

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1018" class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1018" style="width: 150px">![Tea Leaf, Sri Lanka](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2001/03/srilanka6c02-150x150.jpg?resize=150%2C150 "Tea Leaf, Sri Lanka")<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1018">Tea Leaf, Sri Lanka</figcaption></figure>Sometimes people get here by the least obvious route. For example, most months I get a few hits from people searching for the words “my website.” What are they hoping to find? Are they expecting Google to figure out what they mean by “my”? Or is it just that there are an awful lot of very bored people just searching for random phrases?

There are also some oddities, I think anyway. My most popular picture is just of a tea leaf! (From when I was in the tea growing region of [Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html "Sri Lanka Photographs").) It’s basically just a standard record shot, and even has a horizontal line across the middle where the lab scratched the negative. Not my greatest photograph. Some day I’ll invest the time to clean it up in Photoshop.

I figure I get a number of disappointed readers when they hop onto my site after searching for “Cuba girls.” I don’t know, maybe they are looking for girls chatting while leaning against a rusting old American car but somehow I suspect not. (This image from my time in [Trinidad, Cuba](/travel/cuba.html "Cuba Photographs").)

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1271" class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_1271" style="width: 300px">![Girls chat in the street, Trinidad, Cuba](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/img_0127-300x199.jpg?resize=300%2C199 "Girls chat in the street, Trinidad, Cuba")<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1271">Girls chat in the street, Trinidad, Cuba</figcaption></figure>Most comments, it turns out, are not from “real” people at all. It was depressing to learn that most of my “readers” are just computer programs, and not very intelligent ones at that.

For a few months now I have been using the Akismet spam filter which has been doing an excellent job of removing such messages before you or I have to see them. I recently decided to bolster this with Paul Butler’s [JS SpamBlock](http://www.paulbutler.org/ "JS SpamBlock for WordPress"), which means that if you don’t have JavaScript enabled you may have to enter a random number when you post a comment. If you do have JavaScript enabled — and if you don’t know what I’m talking about you probably do — then everything should Just Work. In return I have seen my comment spam drop from around five thousand a month to virtually zero.

While I’m talking about changes you might see, I have also installed Imthiaz Rafiq’s [WP-PDA](http://imthi.com/wp-pda/ "Wordpress PDA") which allows ZX81.org.uk to be readable on a PDA or smartphones web browser. Seems to work well from [my phone](computing/windows-mobile-5-on-virgin-mobile-uk.html "Windows Mobile phone").
