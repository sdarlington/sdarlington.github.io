- [Spam blights e-mail 15 years on](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7322615.stm) – The thing that I'll never understand is that some people must read spam otherwise it wouldn't be a profitable business. Why?! My domain received over 40000 spam messages last month, none of which I've read so please stop sending them!
- [WordPress 2.5](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/) – I just upgraded to the latest version of WordPress. I don't think I've managed to break anything but please do let me know if you know differently.
- [Adobe Photoshop Express Now Live](http://gizmodo.com/372726/adobe-photoshop-express-now-live-free-online-photoshop-for-everyone) – A neat, on-line mini-Photoshop is now available in beta at least. Clearly some way short even of Elements but it's probably sophisticated enough for a lot of people.
