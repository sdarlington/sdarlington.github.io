[![Sheep at Stone Henge](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4145/5132383164_397e96afdd.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5132383164/ "Sheep at Stone Henge by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Not sure why but this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Fluffy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001028.php),” was pretty hard. I thought of clouds. Of cotton wood (urgh). I don’t know, but none of that really worked for me. I’m not sure that a sheep fits the theme any better, but that’s what I’ve entered. This was taken on a trip this year to [Stone Henge](/travel/salisbury.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/architecture.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Architecture](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1026).” I’m entry number 251.
