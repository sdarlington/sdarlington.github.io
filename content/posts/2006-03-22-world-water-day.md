In the West we take having clean, running water so much for granted that when [we can’t drench our gardens in the stuff we complain like the world is about to end](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4799446.stm). And this is in the London area where most people don’t even have gardens!

Maybe it takes something like [World Water Day](http://www.worldwaterday.org/) to make us realise how lucky we are.
