This weeks [PhotoFriday theme is “Large.”](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000668.php "PhotoFriday: Large") Here is my entry.

These large Christmas decorations were spotted when I was in [Charlotte, North Carolina](/travel/misc2003.html) back in 2003. In case you were wondering, this image was taken on Ilford XP2 film on my [EOS300](/photography/camera-gear.html).
