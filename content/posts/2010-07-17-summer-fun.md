The phrase “[Summer Fun](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000997.php),” which is this weeks PhotoFriday theme, conjures up images of children splashing in brightly coloured paddling pools, beach volley ball and barbecues lasting well into the late, twilight hours. Unfortunately I don’t have pictures of any of those things. So here is a picture of a summer sunset over [Brighton beach](/photography/brighton-sunset.html). I think walking on the beach, late in the evening while it’s still light is considered fun.

Please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, [“Bloom.”](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=995) I’m entry number 284.
