[![Chrysler Building](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4872226370_59903b8d43.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4872226370/ "Chrysler Building by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I have plenty of pictures of buildings, so [this weeks PhotoFriday theme](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001093.php) should have been simple. But finding *the* building rather than just *a* building was a little harder than I initially thought it might be. In the end I went for this picture of the Chrysler Building in [New York](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/new-new-york.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/shade.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Shade](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1091).” I’m entry number 166.
