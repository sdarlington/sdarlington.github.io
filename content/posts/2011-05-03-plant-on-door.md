[![Tulip on a door](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5632207541_bc8fd739e5.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5632207541/ "Tulip on a door by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Can anyone explain the significance of this? I was in [Rhodes Old Town](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/rhodes-town-greece.html) and stumbled across this scene. Why would you put a plant on a door like that?
