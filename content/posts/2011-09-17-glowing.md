I’d walked across this square, in the City of London, for weeks before, one evening, I went past at dusk and saw that the pavement was “[Glowing](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001119.php),” which, by strange coincidence, is this weeks PhotoFriday theme.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/near.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Near](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1117).” I’m entry number 164.
