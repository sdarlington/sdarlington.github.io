Here is my entry for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Grandeur](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001192.php).” For those that have been following the current series of The Apprentice, you’ll realise that this image represents English Sparkling Wine. In this case, I’ve stretched the concept even further. In the programme, it was a French word used to describe an English sparkling wine. Here, it’s a bottle of Italian, still wine. Never mind.
