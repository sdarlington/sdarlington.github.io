[![Genoese fort, Porto, Corsica](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7449/11994984574_5d246769df.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11994984574/ "Genoese fort, Porto, Corsica by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

I have no particular reason for posting this picture of a fort in [Porto](/travel/corsica-evisa-to-porto.html), [Corsica](/travel/corsica-back-to-ajaccio.html). I just like it!
