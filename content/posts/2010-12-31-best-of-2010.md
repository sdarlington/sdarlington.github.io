[![Man asleep in the Tokyo International Forum](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4153/5093742673_6159c43e61.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5093742673/ "Man asleep in the Tokyo International Forum by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

How to interpret the PhotoFriday theme this week, “[Best of 2010](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001045.php)“? Something that signifies 2010 in some way? “Just” the best image of 2010? If so, by what definition of “best”? This is hard.

But in the end I went for the above shot, which was taken in the Tokyo International Forum.

Why? It’s no great shakes technically — the glare in the top left is even a little distracting — but there’s something about the muted colours, the neatness. And it says something about Japan that this guy, clearly not homeless, not a drunk, had no qualms just lying down and [sleeping in a public place](/travel/japan-sleeping.html).

But ultimately the short answer is that it makes me smile when I see it.
