I didn’t have an exact picture in mind for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Costume](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000846.php),” but I did have an event: on the [Norwegian Constitution Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Constitution_Day) there’s a huge parade in most major cities, including the biggest which is in [Oslo](/travel/norway.html).

So I fired up iPhoto to see which was the best image to use and… they weren’t there. So I spent much of this afternoon finding my negatives and scanning the whole, missing roll of film in. I’d forgotten why I’d moved to digital!

Anyway, I liked this picture as it combines the traditional — the costume — and the modern — the mobile phone. I think the Nordic countries seem to manage this compromise between the two better than most countries.

Oh, and please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Iconic](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=844).” I’m entry number 120.
