After leaving [Monteriggioni](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/monteriggioni-tuscany-italy.html) I aim the car towards Castelline in Chianti, an area well known for its wineries.

And, well, I passed a few. After they thinned out I did a U-turn and went back to the first one which looked the most promising. From the road there was a long, straight line of trees either side of the drive up to the farm house at the end. It was a bumpy drive and I pulled in next to a couple of other waiting cars. I got out and strolled towards the entrance.

All the doors, however, were closed. I hear conversation and laughing inside but there was no external sign of life.

Another car arrived while I was looking around. I conveyed the little information that I had, and the couple in the car decided to look in a barn on the other side of the car park. If itâ€™s possible, that looked even less open than the farm house.

So lacking any opportunity to learn about, taste or purchase wine, I took a few pictures and returned to the car. Not my most successful visit of the day.
