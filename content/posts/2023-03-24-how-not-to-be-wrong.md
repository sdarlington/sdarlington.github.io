<span style="font-size: revert;">“</span>[How not to be wrong: The art of changing your mind](https://amzn.to/422RJ2t)<span style="font-size: revert;">” is a follow-up to James O’Brien’s earlier book, “</span>[How to be right](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/how-to-be-right.html)<span style="font-size: revert;">.” The idea this time is that he walks through a number of areas where he has been wrong in the past and has changed his mind.</span>

It’s such a simple concept, but, as a society, we have difficulty doing exactly that. Politicians are criticised for doing the wrong thing and then again for doing a u-turn. Tribal loyalty means that people won’t change their minds if that would mean agreeing with “the enemy.” I’m not putting myself above this<sup>[1](#fn1-16568 "see footnote")</sup>, sadly, and neither does O’Brien.

He explores a wide range of subjects, from corporal punishment in schools, to stop and search, tattoos, fat-shaming and trans rights. For some subjects, he admits he was wrong, others we discover that it’s [all a bit more complicated than that](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/reading-2016.html), and that, perhaps, anyone with absolute certainty is missing something. We’d be better off as a society if people were willing to say “I don’t know” more often.

The debates are a mixture of personal anecdotes and transcripts from guests on his radio show. It’s simply structured and competently written. His earnest, chummy, man-of-the-people vibe, also present in his earlier book, grated on me more this time for some reason. Overall I’d say that I like the *idea* of the book more than the execution.

Like his previous effort, it’s not a *bad* book but nor is it an essential read.
