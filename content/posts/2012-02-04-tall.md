[![Chrysler Building](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4135/4872226370_59903b8d43.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4872226370/ "Chrysler Building by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

One thing that distinguishes New York from other large cities is how *high* it is. Even the small buildings have a dozen floors; they’d be considered quite large even in London. So I thought that a picture from [New York](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/new-new-york.html), here of the Chrysler Building, would fit the bill for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Tall](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001158.php).”

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/greenery.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Greenery](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1156).” I’m entry number 157.
