This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[What is that?](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000744.php)” Here is my entry.

The caption when you hover your mouse over the picture might be a bit of a give-away, but it’s not entirely obvious what it’s a picture of, so I think it fits the theme. It was taken in [Cuba](/travel/cuba.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Misty](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=741).” I’m entry 196 (–&gt; Stephen &lt;--).
