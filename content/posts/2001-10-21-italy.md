Most of my recent trips have been prompted by a change of jobs, and this one was no exception. I decided on Northern Italy as I’d been there before, but only when I was eleven or so. I had great memories of the place — well, a great milk-shake in Sirmeone — and wanted to explore the area more and see what the place looked like from an adults perspective.

Last time we’d been based near Venice. This time I stayed away from the coast and flew into Milan’s Linate airport, spent a day there (Milan, not the airport!) and then headed, by rail, to Desenzano del Garda, a small town on the south side of Lago di Garda (Lake Garda). From here I was able to visit Verona and see the delights of the other towns on the lake.

All shots were taken with my EOS. I experimented with a number of different films on this trip: Fuji Superia 100, Fuji Reala 100, Kodak Royal Gold 100 and Fuji Velvia 50. Due to the quality of the scans, you can’t really tell the difference but the prints do vary. Differences in colour saturation are mainly due to the light and polarisation.

If the pictures have piqued your interest, there are a few web Sites that you might want to visit:

- [Italian Tourist Web Site](http://www.itwg.com/). Where I booked one of my hotels.
- I used the Michelin “in your pocket” guide to the Italian Lakes (from Amazon [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/2066521019/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/2066521019/zx81orguk00)) and the Insight Milan FlexiMap (from Amazon [UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0841620830/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0841620830/zx81orguk00)).
- As always, there’s a Lonely Planet guide. You can buy a copy from Amazon ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864503521/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864503521/zx81orguk00)).
