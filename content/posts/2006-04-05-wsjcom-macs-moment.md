It’s nice to see an article about [Apple](http://www.apple.com/uk/ "Apple") that’s not about the iPod! This time a [reasonably sized Japanese company has switched most of it’s 2300 PCs over to Mac’s](http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB114304862088305343-lMyQjAxMDE2NDAzMzAwNDM4Wj.html).

It’s a sensible move if you ask me! Given the ease of use, lack of virus and availability of [MS Office](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/office2004/office2004.aspx?pid=office2004 "Microsoft Office 2004") I’ve never quite understood why Mac’s are not in wider use. I guess we need more conversions like this to reassure people that it’s not a foolish move.

The annoucement of a beta version of [software to allow Windows XP to run on new Intel Macs](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/ "BootCamp"), isn’t going to hurt either.
