[![Junior and Christmas Stockings](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7011/6525794075_076e822d1e.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniordarling/6525794075/ "Junior and Christmas Stockings by juniordarling, on Flickr")

I took a pretty literal interpretation of this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Best of 2011](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001148.php).” I guess I could have used something that signified highlights of the year on a global scale, say my exclusive and so far unreleased images of Osama bin Laden and Gaddafi, but, frankly, nothing better signifies 2011 to me than the birth of my son a few weeks ago.

The stocking, incidentally, is a family tradition. Junior is, to my knowledge, the first person to actually fit inside one.
