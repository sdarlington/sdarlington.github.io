For this weeks PhotoFriday, “Slick,” I was going for the ‘superficially impressive’ meaning of the word. To be fair, I have no reason to believe that these guys are *not* deep and meaningful types… They were seen in [Tokyo](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/japan-tokyo.html) last year.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/animal.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Animal](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1123).” I’m entry number 220.
