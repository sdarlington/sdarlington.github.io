This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Dead of Night](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000724.php).” Here is my entry.

This was taken using my old film SLR, on black and white film, in Vigland Park, [Oslo](/travel/norway.html). I’m not sure it was actually dead of night, but the place was empty and the specks in the sky are stars rather than dust.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Two](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=722).” I’m entry number 291.
