I recently went to a BCS talk entitled “[Eight Significant Events in Computing](http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.20824).” In the question and answers session at the end, one attendee noted that most innovations were Western in general, from the USA in particular. There are a good number of exceptions but, okay. He continued: the result of a Capitalist system and not Communist or Fascist. Again, I’m not sure that this is entirely true.

But it was his final point that floored me: IT innovations were mostly Christian. A few confused looks made him clarify with the line, “There are no Buddhist Computer Systems.”

I’m not really sure what a Buddhist computer system would look like, but I came up with the following list that would possibly qualify:

- The concept of karma means that every time the application crashes, next time it starts you get a new, useful feature
- Processes that crash are reincarnated rather than restarted
- Long running processes (dæmons) therefore are said to be in nirvana

Then again, I wasn’t convinced that we actually have Christian computer systems either. Surely a Christian system would have the following properties:

- A vast user manual written by people who claim to have seen the software
- And translated some time later into a kind of pidgin English
- The first half of the manual would be about version 1.0 of the product, which users still claimed was absolutely accurate. Even the bits that contradicted those in version 2.0
- Both versions, but especially version 1.0, often erased your hard-disk or deleted child processes
- Whether erasing your hard-disk or deleting child processes is a bad thing or not is still hotly debated by some users
- Although version 3.0 has been around for a while, many users still cling to earlier versions
- Despite having a third of the market, users often claim that they are being persecuted by people using other software or no software at all

Can you think of any more?
