If you’re a regular visitor you will note that the ZX81 has an exciting new look and feel. It has never looked more like a real ZX81. It’s also about as usable as a real ZX81, though it does have more memory available and the wobbly RAM pack is likely to be less of a concern.

I’m currently running it as a one day trial but may extend if popular. Please let me know what you think.

**Update:**

Due to popular demand, I have reverted to the old look-and-feel for ZX81. People seemed to think the new visuals introduced yesterday was an April Fool…

If you missed it, here’s what this page looked like:
