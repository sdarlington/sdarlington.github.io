I’m a big fan of William Boyd. Late last year, I went to the [Wimbledon Book Festival](https://www.thebookseller.com/news/wimbledon-bookfest-announces-2024-line-up) to see him interviewed and talk about “Gabriel’s Moon,” his new book. The event wasn’t just about the book, though he did read the prologue. I was predisposed to like him, of course, but I thought he came across well. Smart but not pretentious, aware of his success but hadn’t let it define him. Although I hadn’t planned to, I bought a copy of the book and got it signed.

[Gabriel’s Moon](https://amzn.to/4jHDaug) [affiliate link] is a kind of spy novel, set in the sixties mostly. I say “kind of” as he’s manipulated into it and part of the fun is Gabriel figuring out what’s happening and seeing him lean into his accidental role.

It is an entertaining read. It’s not [his best work](/posts/2024-09-25-any-human-heart/), but it’s enjoyable and well written. It’s about on par with [Solo](/posts/2018-01-16-solo/), and not just because of the spy theme. The story is twisty with some good characters and a mostly satisfying ending.
