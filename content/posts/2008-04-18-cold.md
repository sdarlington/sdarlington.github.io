This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Cold](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000764.php).” Here is my entry. Having spent nearly ten months working and living in Norway I had a number of good options here, but I think this image of [Tromsø](/travel/norway.html) is a good indication of the *cold*, dark winters they get 400km north of the Arctic Circle. This picture was taken at about 3pm.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Fragile](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=762).” I’m entry number 222.
