This weeks PhotoFriday, “[Crooked](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001002.php),” is another one where I thought someone else must have got there before me (especially since I’m two days behind the “Friday” schedule). But, as far as I can tell, no one else has gone for “[The Crookedest Street in the World](http://www.thetraveleditor.com/article/4255/Things_to_do_Introduction_Lombard_Street_The_Crookedest_Street_in_the_World_San_Francisco.html).” Also known as Lombard Street in [San Francisco](/travel/san-francisco-2.html).

(My second choice would have been potentially libellous images of banks or stock exchanges. It maybe just as well I didn’t need to go down that route.)

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/sky-high.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Sky-High](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1000).” I’m entry number 229.
