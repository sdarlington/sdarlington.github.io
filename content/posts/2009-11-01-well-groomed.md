I thought I’d go for the pun with this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Well Groomed](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000925.php).” This was taken at [my friends Civil Partnership ceremony](/blog/a-very-civil-partnership.html). I figure that a wedding with two grooms could be considered “well groomed.”

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/autumn-2009.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Autumn 2009](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=923).” I’m entry number 208.
