This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[The Beach](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000704.php "PhotoFriday: The Beach").” Here is my entry.

When I first saw the challenge I thought of the [Danny Boyle movie](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0163978/ "The Beach") of the same name. Unfortunately I didn’t go anywhere near a beach when I went to [Thailand](/travel/thailand.html "My Thailand trip"), and when I went to Ha Long Bay in [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html "My Vietnam trip") it was so foggy you could barely see it was there! So instead my entry is a picture of Baker Beach in [San Francisco](/travel/san-francisco.html "A later trip to San Francisco") from my first trip to [California](/travel/california-2006.html "My trip to California").

Also, please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Fantasy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=702 "PhotoFriday: Fantasy").” I’m entry number 160.
