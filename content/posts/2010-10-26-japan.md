[![Imperial Palace, Tokyo](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4088/5093738753_78f49897de.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5093738753/ "Imperial Palace, Tokyo by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

At the beginning of October I visited Japan for the first time. I landed in Tokyo, travelled out to Mount Fuji and then west to Nagano Prefecture, finally heading back to Tokyo via Kyoto and Nara. It was a lot to try to pack in to two weeks but it worked out pretty well all things considered.

Over the next couple of weeks Iâ€™ll be documenting in words and pictures my trip, focusing mainly on the locations but with odd entry about the things that seemed constant throughout my time there.

Speaking of constants, I picked the above image to front this series of posts because it seems to combine both elements of the historic and the modern, a motif that was present throughout the trip in many different forms.
