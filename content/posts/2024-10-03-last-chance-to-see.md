*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series*.

I almost didn’t include this since I inadvertently created a new “one book per author” rule. (I did resist adding Dirk Gently.)

[This book](https://amzn.to/3TFoIax) \[affiliate link\[ is about Douglas Adams adventures visiting some of the most endangered creatures on the planet. Not *the* most endangered necessarily, but it includes a nice cross-section, including the cute and the scary.

This was Adams’ induction into nature conservations — something that he took seriously in later life — and you can feel his enthusiasm. The passion is (almost) catching.

Last Chance to See is non-fiction, but Adams’ writing is, if anything, better than his novels.
