There are quite a lot of options for a theme like “[Square](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000942.php),” but in the end I decided on this one of a *square* access hatch covered in graffiti. I’m not sure whether “Earth Liberation Front” is a serious organisation or not but the name amused me.

It was taken in Corniglia, one of the towns of the [Cinque Terre](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cinque-terre-tuscany-italy.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/best-of-2009.html) in the last challenge of last year, “[Best of 2009](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=939).” I’m entry number 188.
