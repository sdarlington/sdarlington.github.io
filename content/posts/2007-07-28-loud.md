This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Loud](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000688.php "PhotoFriday: Loud"). Here is my entry.

It must be *loud* in [Galle, Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html "Sri Lanka images") otherwise they wouldn’t need these “no horns” signs. This picture was taken on Kodak ISO400 print film, hence the heavy grain.

Please vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, [Vacation](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=686 "PhotoFriday: Vacation"). I’m entry number 137.
