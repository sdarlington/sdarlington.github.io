[![Cao Dai ceremony at Tay Ninh, Vietnam](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/10817504236_1ff84769fe.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817504236/ "Cao Dai ceremony at Tay Ninh, Vietnam by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

When I thought of the word “organised” my brain leapt to the word “religion,” hence this picture of a ceremony in Vietnam. It’s a strange mix of a number of popular religions and has a few thousand followers. The theme also works in the sense that the regular columns of worshipers are also very organised.
