I liked Bruce Schneier’s article in Wired entitled [The Scariest Terror Threat of All](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71152-0.html?tw=wn_index_15). Most articles we see these days are asking for *more* surveillance and intrusions into our private lives in order to fight the “War of Terrorism,” but this one explains why all that effort is misdirected.

> \[G\]ood terrorist ideas are a dime a dozen. Anyone can figure out how to cause terror. The hard part is execution.

He builds his case by asking readers of his blog to post suggestions for the next big terror attack. Certainly imagination is not in short supply as some of the plots are truely scary and downright evil.

He concludes:

> Terrorism has always been rare, and for all we’ve heard about 9/11 changing the world, it’s still rare.
