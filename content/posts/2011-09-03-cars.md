[Cars](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001115.php), this weeks PhotoFriday theme, seem such every-day sights that it’s easy to think that they’re not worth taking pictures of unless it’s something exotic. However, for some reason, I was taking pictures of the local shopping centre, so I have this image of a bunch of cars.

There’s no need to feel guilty for not voting for me in last weeks challenge since I didn’t get the time to post an entry.
