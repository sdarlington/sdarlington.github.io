“But it was only twenty past eight…”

This weeks PhotoFriday theme is [Fast](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000634.php "PhotoFriday: Fast"). This image was taken in my kitchen with my EOS300D and lightly edited in Photoshop. Unfortunately it’s probably a better idea than a photograph — and maybe not even that!

Please vote for my entry in [last weeks PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=632 "PhotoFriday: Peaceful"). I’m entry number 422.
