This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Purity](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000674.php "PhotoFriday: Purity").” Here is my entry. It was taken at a Cao Dai ceremony in Tay Ninh, [Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html "Vietnam pictures and commentary"). These ceremonies and white cloaks suggest a type of purity.
