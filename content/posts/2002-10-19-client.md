**Oracle Data Browser**

Oracle Data Browser, part of the Discover 2000 suite, is one of the least amusing applications that Oracle supply. Not because it’s bad, but because it almost works…

- Windows 95 has a ‘full screen drag’ feature (freely download-able from [Microsoft](http://www.eu.microsoft.com)‘s web site). If you load Data Browser you don’t. It suddenly stops working.
- Now this is supposed to be a feature, but I’m not convinced. The word ‘Browser’ seems to indicate that it’s a read-only product. In fact a version comes with it that isn’t.

**Oracle Data Query**

Until we started really *using* SmartClient, we thought that Data Query, half of the Discoverer 2000 suite, was the lemon of the Oracle product library. That’s not to say that it’s good, just that after all that’s happened with Applications we’ve more or less forgotten a lot of the really annoying stuff. Lucky Oracle.

- Data Query makes Windows 2.0 seem stable. Even in it’s 32-bit version.
- It often magically moves the input focus to somewhere you don’t want.
