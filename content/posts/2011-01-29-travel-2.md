This weeks PhotoFriday theme is one you’d think I have many possible choices: “[Travel](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001053.php).” I note that a few of the earlier entries are pictures taken while *travelling* which I don’t think is quite the same thing.

My entry is about the process of travel, the open road, the destination being far away. This is also a sort of timely image, since it was taken in [Egypt](/travel/egypt-mount-sinai.html), a country that’s currently very much in the news.

There was also a PhotoFriday challenge “Travel” a while ago. I posted a [completely different picture](/photography/photofriday/travel.html) back then.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/trees.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Trees](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1051).” I’m entry number 276.
