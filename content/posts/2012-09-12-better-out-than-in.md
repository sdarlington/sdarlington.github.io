Today marks “Juniors” nine month “birthday,” so, unless you want to be pedantic and count the exact number of weeks, he’s been “out” for as long as he was *in utero*.

His progress has been [well documented elsewhere](http://www.brandarling.com/) so I won’t go into detail, but it’s fair to say that it’s been an eventful few months.

It’s been a big learning experience for everyone.

Amongst other things I’ve learned that some postcards are tastier than others; that the [MagSafe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) connector does not live up to its name in some respects; that more things than you think are within the reach of someone less than a metre tall; that parrots can be green and have squeekers; that boys are drawn to buttons and remote controls; and that most food can be eaten lukewarm if the alternative is small hands swiping it and then smiling at you.

I’m sure that there will be a lot more to learn as he starts to walk and grows to the point where even the higher shelves are accessible…
