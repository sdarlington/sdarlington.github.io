- [The Best of Technology Writing 2007](http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/book-review-2008-03.ars) – I just finished reading this book myself yesterday. I was considering writing a review but Ars got there first and said it better than I would have done!
- [Protests in Tibet erupt into violence](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/14/tibet.china1) – Violence is never a good thing, but the Olympics is undoubtedly a good time to try to raise the profile of the plight of the Tibetan people.
- [Open Rights Group questions Phorm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7291637.stm) – Good to see TalkTalk, BT and Virgin Media's abuse of their own customers getting more press.
