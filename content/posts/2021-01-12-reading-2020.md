As with 2019, I had the goal of reading twelve books in 2020 and, again, I missed that target by one book. I finished “[How To](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/how-to.html)” on New Years Eve so I can’t even claim to have got close.

If I have a defence for missing the target, other than it being 2020 of course, it’s that a few of the books were quite long. Discussing politics apparently takes a lot of words.

Only one of the [eleven books](https://www.zx81.org.uk/tag/reading2020) I read was non-fiction. It was… *fine*. I plan to read more novels this year.

As I look back on what I wrote, books being a bit *meh*, kind of *fine*, was a theme. I don’t think I read a *bad* book in 2020, one where I wanted the hours back, but many were quite forgettable.

Highlights? [Unix: A History and a Memoir](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/unix-a-history-and-a-memoir.html). [Facebook](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/facebook-the-inside-story.html). [How to be a Liberal](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/how-to-be-a-liberal.html).

I’ve set the same challenge — twelve books — for 2021. Wish me luck. My past record suggests I’ll need it!
