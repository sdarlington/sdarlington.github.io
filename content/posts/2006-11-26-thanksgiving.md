\[photopress:DSCN0161.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]On Saturday we hosted the first Thanksgiving dinner at Chez Darlington. Due to the size of our kitchen this became a bit of a logistical nightmare but we persevered.

Well, I say “we” but pretty much all the cooking was down to B with me in more of a motivational role, insisting that the spinach and cheese casserole smelled really good and that the turkey looked great. I got the easy job as it was true!

Our guests helped with the rest of the food, with MC bringing the snacks, AP concocting a butternut squash and tomato side, PG and IY providing the drinks and EL baked banana and pumpkin bread.

I think it’s fair to say that we all left thankful to have such great friends and completely [pogged](http://bcuk.blogspot.com/2006/10/britishisms.html "Another Britishism for B") from all the food.
