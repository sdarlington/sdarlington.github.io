My entry for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Pet](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000850.php),” really had to be an image of our dear, departed goldfish [Cornelius Maximus Willmington IV](http://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/so-long.html). It may not be the best photograph in the world, but how could you not love a fish who [couldn’t float properly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzb6OFhGU6U)?

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-team.html) in last weeks challenge, “[The Team](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=848).” I am entry number 189.
