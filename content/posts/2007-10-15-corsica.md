[![Flying to Corsica](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/11994883293_918a0eee07.jpg?resize=500%2C375)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/11994883293/ "Flying to Corsica by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

As I fly over it, I note the vivid blue-green colour of the water as it glistens in the midday sun. This is not the Mediterranean as I approach Corsica but the English Channel shortly after leaving from London City airport. It’s amazing how the sun enhances even the most seemingly mundane scenes.

It’s three hours and a change of plane in [Paris](/travel/paris-2006.html) before I see Corsica for real. In fact it was cloudy and only visible for the last few minutes of the descent. First impressions: very hilly, mountainous even. The cream houses scattered near the coast are attractive and give the impression of a place that is in the [south of France](/travel/alps-to-riviera-france-2005.html) or [Tuscany](/travel/italy2.html).

As I walk much of the Mare a Mare Nord path I discover that it has a character of its own. Starting near the Corsican capital, Ajoccio, I take the train up to Corte and walk much of the route over to the west coast at Porto. For an island of its size, Corsica’s landscape is amazingly varied and beautiful.
