*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

It’s a slow-burner [of a book](https://amzn.to/3XN46ys) \[affiliate link\]. Everyone said how great it was. It took me a while to read and I thought it was a bit meh.

But over time its impact seeps in. You notice the rings on your hob, the hints about which way a door opens (often incorrectly), forcing function on ATMs.

After a while you realise you’re noticing these things because you read the book. Maybe it wasn’t so meh after all.
