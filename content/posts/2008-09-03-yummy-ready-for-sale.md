![Ready for Sale](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/picture-1.png?resize=348%2C113 "Ready for Sale")

I nearly posted a rude one-liner on Twitter about it. I was sat here in front of my laptop, browsing iTunes and slightly miffed that I’d submitted my iPhone application a week ago and that there had been no sign of movement since then.

Then I received an email from Apple with the good news. So yes, as I type this I don’t see it, but apparently [Yummy](https://www.wandlesoftware.com/yummy) is now “ready for sale” and will be making its way to the App Store very shortly. (I assume it’s a gradual process and that some people may be able to see it now.)

How exciting is that?!

Update: [Yummy is now on the AppStore](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=289374576&mt=8) (opens in iTunes).

Update (2023): The link to Yummy’s website has been updated to point to Wandle Software, which didn’t exist at the time of launch.
