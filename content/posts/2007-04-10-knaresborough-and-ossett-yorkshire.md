\[photopress:IMG\_3220.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]This Easter we hired a car and zipped through London, from the source of the M1 at Brent Cross right up to Junction 40, which is how [Ossett](http://folk.uio.no/alied/TMoL.html "OSSETT (n.) A frilly spare-toilet-roll-cosy.") is better known in many circles. This is where I grew up and is where my parents still live.

Easter in the UK is often somewhat hit and miss weather-wise but this time luck was on our side. Bright sun and unseasonably high temperatures — warmer than in Spain [according to the BBC news](http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/news/08042007news.shtml "Glad we weren't in Moscow!") — meant that we had to get out of the house. After consulting the map and discounting Haworth and Holmfirth (([Haworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haworth "Haworth") is “[Bronte](http://www.bronte.org.uk/ "Brontes")” country, but would have taken a while to get to. [Holmfirth](http://www.area5.org.uk/ "Holmfirth") is most famous for “[Last of the Summer Wine](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/l/lastofthesummerw_7774090.shtml "BBC Comedy Last of the Summer Wine")” but there’s not much there if you’ve never seen the programme.)), we decided on [Knaresborough](http://www.knaresborough.co.uk/ "Knaresborough Online"). I’d been a few times as a kid but I’ve not visited for over ten years. It was good to go back.

The most obvious feature is the river and the still operational viaduct.

We wandered by the side of the river and, eventually, gathered the courage to climb the steep hill up to the castle. Some great views over the valley were our reward.

\[photopress:IMG\_3196.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]From the top it was just a short walk into town for some lunch ((On our second attempt. Typical Yorkshire friendliness deserted the waitresses in the first cafe we visited.)). Suitably refreshed we ducked into some of the many small book-shops and second-hand record shops. We were highly amused to find vinyl copies of Duran Duran’s “[Seven and the Ragged Tiger](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gifoxqt5ldke "Duran Duran's Seven and the Ragged Tiger")” and a 12″ of Sinitta’s “[So Macho](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=SINITTA&sql=11:wifexqr5ld0e~T0 "Sinitta").” Classic.

We gradually meandered back down the hill towards the river. The light was getting lower and warmer, resulting in some beautiful scenes.

Back in Ossett, while waiting for my mums lovely Sunday roast, we went for a quick walk. We decided on an area a few minutes away creatively called “The Fields.” (I’m sure it has an official name but that’s what everyone I know calls it.)

\[photopress:IMG\_3209.jpg,thumb,alignleft\]We passed under the M1 and up the hill you see to the left. The idyllic scene you see in the foreground is only slightly spoiled when you learn that the whole area used to be a mine and that you’re standing on slag heaps! The good news is that it’s not very practical to build on, so it should be around for many years to come.

The weekend finished with the drive back down the M1 and through London. Despite dire warnings, the traffic wasn’t too bad and we got home in good time. A peaceful end to a great weekend.
