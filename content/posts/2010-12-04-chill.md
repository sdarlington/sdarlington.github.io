[![Colliers Wood Snow](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4068/4251564090_c14a11e37c.jpg?resize=500%2C334)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4251564090/ "Colliers Wood Snow by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Given the sub-zero temperatures that we’re experiencing in the UK, this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Chill](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001038.php),” is very appropriate. I can’t, however, really use one of the pictures I took [earlier this week](/photography/early-snow.html)[^1] so instead this one was taken in January this year in our first snows of 2010.

I didn’t post an entry to last weeks challenge so there’s no need to feel bad for not voting for me(!).
[^1]: Posting the same pictures twice in one week somehow seems wrong!
