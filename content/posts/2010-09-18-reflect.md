[![Chrysler Building](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4135/4872226370_59903b8d43.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/4872226370 "Chrysler Building by Stephen Darlington, on Flickr")

In fact I’m not completely happy with this image, at least for the theme of “[Reflect](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001016.php),” which is this weeks PhotoFriday challenge. It’s a reflect*ion* but I’m not completely sure that it means “reflect.” But I couldn’t find one (or think of one to take) that would be more appropriate, so here it is. It was taken earlier this year in [New York](/travel/new-new-york.html) — it’s a reflection of the Chrysler Building in the building across the road from it.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/daybreak.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Daybreak](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1014).” I’m entry number 178.
