This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Grandmother](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000864.php)” and, unfortunately, I don’t have a suitable image this time. But please vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/extreme-closeup.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Extreme Closeup](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=862).” I’m entry number 180.

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1312" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1312" style="width: 500px">![View of Sospel from our hotel, France](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/img_0946.jpg?resize=500%2C333 "View of Sospel from our hotel, France")<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1312">View of Sospel from our hotel, France</figcaption></figure>

Instead here is a picture that I really like that I’ve not shown off as much as I should have done! It was taken in [Sospel, France](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/alps-to-riviera-france-2005.html). This was the view from the front of the hotel we were staying in. My friend got this view, my room was looking out over a shed at the back.
