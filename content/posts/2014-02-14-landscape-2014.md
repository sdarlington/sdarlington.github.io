[![Pink Granite walk between between Perros-Guirec and Ploumanac'h](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/9247676473_e516feb8ec.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/9247676473/ "Pink Granite walk between between Perros-Guirec and Ploumanac'h by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

While a landscape is more typically about *land*, I didn’t really visit anywhere very far inland in the last year, hence this image of a walk between Perros-Guirec and Ploumanac’h in France as my entry in this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Landscape 2014](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1371).” In any case, the landscape here is influenced by the nearby sea so I don’t think I’m too far from the mark!

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/twilight.html "Twilight") in last weeks challenge, “[Twilight](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1369).” I’m entry number 98.
