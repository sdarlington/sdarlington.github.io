I like the every-day grazing cattle contrasted with the “[Distant](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000951.php)” — this weeks PhotoFriday challenge — mountains. This was taken in [Georgia](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/georgia.html) (the country not the US state).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/damaged.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Damaged](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=949).” I’m entry number 59.
