[![Sunset from my office.](https://i0.wp.com/farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8150435976_5952ece9fa.jpg?resize=500%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/8150435976/ "Sunset from my office. by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

It’s dark when I get up in the morning and it’s dark when I leave work in the evening. I’m not a huge fan of this time of year… But, it did mean that I was in central London yesterday for a lovely sunset. Sunset, of course, being the traditional segue into “[Evening](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001235.php),” which is this weeks PhotoFriday theme.
