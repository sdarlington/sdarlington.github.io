I initially thought of posting something else, but I woke up this morning to find a smattering of snow and thought, at this time of year, what’s more “white” than snow? So here’s an image I took in [Arad, Romania](/travel/hungary.html), which is practically monochrome in its whiteness.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/disorder.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Disorder](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=838).” I’m entry number 163.
