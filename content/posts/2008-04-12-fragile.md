This young tea leaf looks pretty [*fragile*](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000762.php) and hence makes a good candidate for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge. I took this picture in [Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Far From Home](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=760).” I’m entry number 143.
