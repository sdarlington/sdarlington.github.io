On our recent trip to [Tuscany](/travel/tuscany-italy.html), [B](http://www.brandarling.com/2008/05/family-holiday-in-tuscany.html) bought a cheap local bottle of wine not because of the wine itself — we’ve not dared taste it yet — but because the bottle was pretty. It’s been sat on the dining room table since then, gathering dust.

Last weekend I decided to take a few pictures of it. It’s not my normal kind of photography but the results were fairly respectable I think.

Neither shot is as sharp as I would have liked. I am not sure whether this is my camera technique, softness of the lens or poor focusing. I liked this view because the fuzziness, if anything, enhanced it.

Both were taken on my [Canon EOS300D](/photography/camera-gear.html) with my very much under-used Sigma 70-300mm. The camera was resting on the table and I used the self-timer to help reduce shake. The white back-ground is actually my living room window.
