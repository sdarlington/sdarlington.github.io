- [The League of Moveable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) – Most free or open source fonts I've seen have been pretty poor but these guys seem to have the right idea.
- [Government plans travel database](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7877182.stm) – "When your travel plans, who you are travelling with, where you are going to and when are being recorded you have to ask yourself just how free is this country?"
- [Learning and Working in the Collaborative Age: A New Model for the Workplace](http://www.edutopia.org/randy-nelson-school-to-career-video) – Fascinating ten minute video on what Pixar look for in candidates, summarised as Depth, Breadth, Communication and Collaboration. Given those criteria I'm guessing they're very selective!
