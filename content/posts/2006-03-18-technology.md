This was a plaque in the German city of Kaiserslautern commemorating Johann Gutenberg, the man generally credited with inventing movable type. The book which, for mass consumption at least, would not have been possible without him has done more to spread knowledge and advance technology than just about anything else in the last thousand years.

I think it is, therefore, a fitting entry to this weeks “Technology” theme on [PhotoFriday](http://www.photofriday.com/).
