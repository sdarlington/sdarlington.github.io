Another late entry for PhotoFriday (this is becoming a theme in and of itself). This weeks image is around the theme “[Bloom](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000995.php)” which I felt pretty much had to be about flowers. These were in [Bath, UK](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/bath-uk.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/motionless.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Motionless](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=993).” I’m entry number 167.
