“[Warm](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001010.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday, is a bit of an alien concept here in the UK so I had to go a little further afield in order to find a picture to represent this weeks theme. This was taken in Tennessee, USA.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/the-street.html) in last weeks challenge, “[The Street](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1008).” I’m entry number 215.
