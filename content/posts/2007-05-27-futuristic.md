This weeks [PhotoFriday theme is “Futuristic.”](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000670.php "PhotoFriday: Futuristic") Here is my entry.

When I think “futuristic” I think “space travel” and “space men.” I’ve never been into space but I have been down Karl Johans Gate in [Oslo, Norway](/travel/norway.html "Norway images").

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, [Large](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=668 "PhotoFriday: Large"). I’m entry number 193.
