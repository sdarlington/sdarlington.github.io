I like the way that the sun spotlights this tiny town in [Corsica](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/corsica.html "Corsica"). You could almost say that it’s “[Dramatic](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1363),” which is why it’s my entry for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge of the same name.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/climate.html "Climate") in last weeks challenge, “[Climate](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1361).” I’m entry number 96.
