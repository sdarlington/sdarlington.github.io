<span style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px;">[My World](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5719164745/), originally uploaded by [stephendarlington](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/).</span></div>I thought I’d take this weeks PhotoFriday theme down to a mundane level and show you what a typical work-day in “[My World](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001083.php)” looks like. You might say that it’s messy. I couldn’t possibly comment.
