- [‘should be cheaper than free’](http://majicjungle.com/blog/?p=472) – "I’m angry at the customers who send me nasty emails or reviews, threatening me with ‘telling Apple to remove it’ or rating it 1 star with a ’should be cheaper than free’ remark because after paying the ridiculously exorbitant 99c, they found it didn’t live up to expectations. "
- [Hurdie Ho!](http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/hurdieho.htm) – Maybe you had to be there and read the copy of Your Sinclair that this was originally published in, but this still makes me laugh.
- [Museum looks at 2000-year history of the computer](http://rss.macworld.com/click.phdo?i=bbeaedadf0bf6e599faa702ace313de3) – The Computer History Museum was excellent even before this new exhibit. Recommended.
