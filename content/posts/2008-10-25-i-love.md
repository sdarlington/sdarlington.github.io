This is one of those rare themes where I actually went out to take a picture specifically for it. I didn’t have to go very far! Marmite is certainly one of those things that you either love or hate. For the purposes of this weeks [PhotoFriday challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000819.php), I’ll claim that “I love… marmite.”

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/freeze-frame.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Freeze Frame](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=817).” I’m entry number 193.
