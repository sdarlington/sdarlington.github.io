It’s odd to feel a sense of loss for someone you never knew. The last time I can remember that this happened was when Douglas Adams died ten years ago. There are not many people like them.

What else can I add that has not already been said? Honestly, I’m not even going to try. Instead, here is a selection of links that I think hit the nail right on the head.

- In his own words. [Jobs’ Stanford Commencement address](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html) is well know but very much worth re-reading. There are many, many great lines but this, much quoted one, is very apt: “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.”
- Scott Adams, like me, is not big on heroes but [considered Jobs to be one](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/1955__2011/)
- Walt Mossberg has some [nice anecdotes](http://allthingsd.com/20111005/the-steve-jobs-i-knew/)
- …and [three important quotes](http://objcolumnist.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-1955-2011/)

There are lots more, you could probably spend most of today reading them all if you tried, but those are probably the highlights of the stuff that I’ve read today.
