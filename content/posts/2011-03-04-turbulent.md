[![Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5053/5497673916_dd1d3d487b.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5497673916/ "Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This is one of those weeks where all the other entries that I saw for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Turbulent](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001063.php),” make zero sense to me. Turbulent means disorder or chaotic which, to me, suggested a bumpy plane ride or a mass of flowing water. In the end I felt that this image of Niagara Falls (from the [Canadian side](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/canada-2005.html)) conveyed the message best. Landscapes or a bed don’t tell the same story to me.

Please also vote for [my image](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/open.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Open](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1061).” I’m entry number 191.
