Eight books [last year](/tags/reading2025/), against my target of twelve. By my historical standards, not bad! Four fiction and four non-fiction is not a bad split, either.

Unusually there were a couple of books that just weren’t for me. Not objectively bad, by any means, but it turns out that [comic books](/posts/2025-03-28-judge-dredd-better-world/) are really not my thing. On the other hand, [William Boyd](/posts/2025-02-07-gabriels-moon/) continues to entertain, and [Mick Herron](/posts/2025-10-17-slow-horses/)’s books are as fun to read as watch.

I can’t remember the last time I hit my annual target but that’s not going to stop me from aiming for twelve books again in 2026. Wish my luck. If past form is any indication, I’ll need it.
