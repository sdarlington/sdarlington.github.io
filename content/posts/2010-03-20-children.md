This weeks PhotoFriday was a tricky one for a couple of reasons. Firstly I don’t have very many pictures of “[Children](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000965.php)” or even anything child-like. Secondly, most of the pictures that I do have I wouldn’t want to use. Thirdly, most of those that didn’t fall into the previous two categories I’ve already used for previous challenges!

In the end I settled on this image I took in southern [Vietnam](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/vietnam-2005.html). I got the impression that they don’t get a huge number of tourists around there. They were very curious of us but also very nervous and wouldn’t come much closer than what you see in the picture.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/nightlife.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Nightlife](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=963).” I’m entry number 202.
