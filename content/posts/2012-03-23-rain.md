“[Rain](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001172.php)” is a good PhotoFriday theme for someone, like myself, who lives in the UK. I could have taken a picture on pretty much any day, but this way taken in August last year. Um, actually, in Ireland rather than at home…

There’s no need to panic and rush to vote for my entry in last weeks challenge since I didn’t enter.
