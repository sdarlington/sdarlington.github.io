One thing that really bugs me is badly formatted code. I’ve nearly written a PL/SQL indentation program a number of times, but have never actually? completed it.

But this time it’s different. I figured that most of the pretty printers out there are very poorly written and work only on one particular programming language. However, most languages are very similar to one another. They all have comments, blocks and ‘if’ statements.

Mine may not be much better written — you be the judge of that — but it is generic, having the capability of working with multiple languages.

It’s currently nowhere near complete, so I have uploaded my current development version to Sourceforge. You can check out the latest version [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gindent/),  
but don’t expect it to actually work for you just yet. There’s currently a nearly working HTML formatter and a very incomplete PL/SQL module.
