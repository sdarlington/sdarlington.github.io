[Spiral](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000787.php) is one of those PhotoFriday themes that I thought I would have plenty of choice in my picture library but in reality I found nothing that I was happy with. I looked up, trying to find inspiration and, well, I found this lucky bamboo.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Religion](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=785).” I’m entry number 118.
