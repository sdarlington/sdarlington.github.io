This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Two](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000722.php "PhotoFriday: Two").” Here is my entry.

This image was taken in?[Kandy, Sri Lanka](/travel/srilanka.html "Sri Lanka pictures"). One of the first pictures I ever took on an SLR, it’s still one of my?favourites.
