It’s at times like these that I feel that I have been short-changed with my [50D](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/canon-eos-50d.html). Both the model above and below it have a HD video feature and mine does not. I’m not one to let these little limitations get in my way though…

With apologies for the size, here are a bunch of images I took in [Yosemite](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/yosemite.html) stitched together into a single animated GIF ((Yes, I’m normally against animated GIFs too, but this was way easier than building a proper movie file.)).

Thanks to [Henry](http://www.henrywagner.com/) for the idea.
