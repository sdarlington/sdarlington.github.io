- [Pope merchandise](http://www.b3ta.com/challenge/pope/) – "The pope is visiting the UK soon, and the merchandise is already on sale, but it's rubbish. This week's challenge is to show the Vatican what they should be selling to mark the occasion. God will be delighted." (via @bengoldacre)
- [The Creativity Crisis](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/10/the-creativity-crisis.html) – "The age-old belief that the arts have a special claim to creativity is unfounded."

But back to the article… it's interesting that you can "teach" or at least encourage creativity.
