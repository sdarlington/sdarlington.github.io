When I initially thought about this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Ride](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001073.php),” my mind first went to cycling. Only I couldn’t find an image that showed bikes in motion which seemed to defeat the point. So, instead, I went for this picture that I took while riding on the [Tokyo](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/japan-tokyo.html) subway. (It might be a bit of a stretch but I really like this picture!)

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/elaborate.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Elaborate](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1071).” I’m entry number 161.
