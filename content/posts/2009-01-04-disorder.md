According to my dictionary, “[Disorder](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000838.php),” this weeks PhotoFriday theme, means “the disruption of peaceful and law-abiding behaviour.” This image of central Hanoi in Vietnam shows locals on scooters blaring their horns (lack of peace) and zipping all over the road in a display that *should* be illegal even if it isn’t. There were certainly worse displays of disorder and chaos on Vietnamese roads but I value my life!
