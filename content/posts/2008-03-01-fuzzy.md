This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Fuzzy](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000750.php).” Here is my entry. Here I’m using the misty, hazy and indistinct definition of “fuzzy.” This image was taken in [Ha Long Bay, Vietnam](/travel/vietnam-2005.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Art](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=748).” I’m number 130.
