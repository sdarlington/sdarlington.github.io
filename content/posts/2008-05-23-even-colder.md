No PhotoFriday entry this week I’m afraid. However, a few weeks ago “Cold” was the theme and I picked [this entry](/photography/photofriday/cold.html) from my travels to [Norway](/travel/norway.html). In hindsight, the above picture, taken in [Arad, Romania](/travel/hungary.html), might have been a better choice.
