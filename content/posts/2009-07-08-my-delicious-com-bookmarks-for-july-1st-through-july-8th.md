- [Evolution Test](http://missinguniversemuseum.com/Evtest.htm) – I just don't get it. Is evolution really that hard? How can you misunderstand it so badly that you can come up with this list of questions and think it proves… well, anything? (Part of me hates to single out this site as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of similar ones.)
- [Crash Could Free Up Wall Street's Grip on Bright Young Minds](http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-07/st_essay) – "But the big paychecks came with what economists call opportunity costs. Instead of spending their days searching for exotic trades, some of these Wall Street wizards could've been creating drugs, imagining software, or solving energy problems."
- [The Norway Lesson: The Benefits of Good Financial Behavior](http://www.behaviorgap.com/the-norway-lesson-the-benefits-of-good-financial-behavior/) – "Norway made it a point to budget, to save, and to protect against unnecessary risk.
