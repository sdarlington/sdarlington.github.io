And welcome to the new look ZX81.org.uk! This time I decided to go “back to basics” with a relatively simple, low-graphics theme. Having said that, it’s not quite as basic as things were back [in late 1999](http://web.archive.org/web/20000818051634/http://www.zx81.org.uk/) when the site first went live ((The Wayback machine only has an entry from August 2000, but the domain was first registered in November 1999 and a minimal placeholder was put up almost immediately.)). It’s less fussy than the old version and should load more quickly for those people not yet on broadband.

The boring details are: I’m using a slightly modified version of [Dagon Design’s](http://www.dagondesign.com/) NightSky theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). Other than a fairly extensive set of plugins, changes were to bring the theme in line for tags and to allow a [daringfireball](http://daringfireball.net/)-style “linked list” rather than the rather more static del.ic.io.us list I had previously.

In theory I’m not missing anything that was present before but, as with any significant change, there is a chance that I missed something. Please let me know if you spot anything odd.
