Wishing you and your family happiness and peace, turkey[^1] and chocolate this festive season, whatever your faith or lack thereof.

The above image, by the way, was taken in [Reykjavik, Iceland](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/iceland.html) a couple of days before Christmas 2006.
[^1]: Or spicy pancake if thatâ€™s your preference.
