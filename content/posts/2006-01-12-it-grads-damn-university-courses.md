We normally see employers complaining that recent graduates don’t have “relevant” skills. This article is an interesting twist on that, with the job-seekers themselves complaining about their courses.

[The Register: IT grads damn university courses](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/11/grads_say_courses_no_good/)

I think both employers and job seekers are missing the point. There’s a difference between “education” and “training.” University degrees should not simply be vocational training, they should teach *principles* that can be applied throughout a career and not just specific technologies that might well have a shelf-life of only a few years.
