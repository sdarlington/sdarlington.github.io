This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Sky-High](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001000.php).” My first thought was a picture from a plane but then I thought it was likely to be a bit of a cliché. Bizarrely I didn’t see many other entrants with the same idea so I went with the above image, taken on my iPhone landing back in London.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/summer-fun.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Summer Fun](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=997).” I’m entry number 279.
