I’ve been busy and not had the time to enter the last few PhotoFriday’s, but here I am with an image for the theme “[Gold](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001109.php)” (always believe in your soul). I have quite a few pictures with bits of gold (you’ve got the power to know) in them, but here, in [Kyoto](/travel/japan-kyoto.html), we have a whole pavilion that’s made of the shiny stuff.

Sorry for the Spandau Ballet puns (you’re indestructible).
