![iPod vs Zune](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/ipod.jpg)

I just read Daniel Eran Dilger’s “[Winter 2007 Buyer?s Guide: Microsoft Zune 8 vs iPod Nano](http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2007/12/03/winter-2007-buyers-guide-microsoft-zune-8-vs-ipod-nano/)” but I felt that it was missing something very important for readers outside the United States.

So to fill that void here is my attempt. I have not actually used any of the new Zunes or iPods but I don’t necessarily feel that this has any material impact on the final result ((Full disclosure: my review is only slightly more biased towards Apple than RoughlyDrafted.)).

The iPod is a small, well made music player with many features albeit less than some of its competitors. It succeeds in doing what it does very well.

The Zune, on the other hand, is [not available outside the US](http://www.t3.co.uk/news/247/entertainment/mp3_player/new_zune__no_plans_for_uk_release). A positive corollary of this is that it’s easy to carry, taking practically no space at all in bags and pockets, and it’s difficult to damage. Another plus is that the person sitting opposite you on the tube can’t use one at high volumes and annoy you with a tinny bass-line and their unashamed bad taste in music.

But, ultimately, the fact that it doesn’t exist has to count against the Zune and so my recommendation for the 2007 Christmas shopping season is Apple’s iPod.
