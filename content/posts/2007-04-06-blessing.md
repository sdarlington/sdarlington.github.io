!["Thank you" slates in a cemetary, Havana](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/img_0038.jpg?resize=333%2C500 ""Thank you" slates in a cemetary, Havana")

This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Blessing](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000656.php "PhotoFriday: Blesing").” Here is my entry.

This was taken in Havana, Cuba. These slates can be found in a cemetery and are blessings for a woman thought to bring good luck and fertility. (If I remember correctly!)
