This weeks PhotoFriday, “[Seashore](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001101.php),” was pretty straightforward since I only got back from [Rhodes](/travel/rhodes-greece.html "Rhodes"), with its famous beaches, a couple of months ago.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/gloomy.html "Gloomy") in last weeks challenge, “[Gloomy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1099).” I’m entry number 149.
