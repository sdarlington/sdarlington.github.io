In one sense this was me trying to cheat my “[twelve books in 2021](/tag/reading2021)” challenge. Does reading two short stories count as two books? Goodreads seems to think so…

But it wasn’t *just* a cheat. These are still stories that I did want to read. Dan Moren is a writer I’ve followed for a while, though entirely in his Mac-centric, technical writing at [Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com)[^1] and podcasting at [Clockwise](https://www.relay.fm/clockwise). The stories are both part of a bigger sci-fi-space-opera universe but work well stand-alone.

Of the two, I enjoyed “Pilot Error” the most. I didn’t see the twist coming, though looking at the remaining page-count I knew that either one was coming or that it was intended as a major cliff-hanger for the follow-up book.

As a short taster for the writing, the characters and the universe, these stories fit the bill. I’ve not managed to read a whole lot of fiction this last year or two, but I’ve added Moran’s books to my list.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, you can [read them for free](https://dmoren.com/writing/short-stories/).
