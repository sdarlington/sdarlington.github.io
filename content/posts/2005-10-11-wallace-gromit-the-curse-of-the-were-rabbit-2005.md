We had a bit of a movie binge this weekend. The highlight was undoubtedly [Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit](http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0312004/). I’ve always been a fan of Nick Park’s work and this is right up there with his best.

How they manage to get so much emotion into such tiny pieces of clay I have no idea. All I can say is that it works.
