If I’d gone with my first instinct, this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Fear](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000911.php),” would have been incredibly easy. Many people fear snakes, but [one person in particular](http://www.brandarling.com/) has had a bad week and I didn’t want to make it any worse. Also, I’ve use that picture before (“[Dangerous](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/dangerous.html)“).

Instead find the above picture of a woman in [Sancti Spiritus, Cuba](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/cuba.html). She looks trapped, fearful. She may be very happy for all I know, but for the purposes of this challenge she is in fear.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/urban-landscape.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Urban Landscape](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=909).” My entry is number 263.
