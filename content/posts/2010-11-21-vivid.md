[![Tromsø (Norway) waterfront. These are local museums.](https://i0.wp.com/farm5.staticflickr.com/4084/5195012523_68113fc87d.jpg?resize=500%2C331)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5195012523/ "Tromsø (Norway) waterfront. These are local museums. by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Late to the party again, but I finally found what I think is a suitable image for this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Vivid](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001034.php).” This picture was taken so long ago that it’s actually on film (remember that?). It’s in [Tromso, Norway](/travel/norway.html). I thought the colours of the buildings and sky were very bright, deep and vivid contrasted with the snow.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Liquid](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1032).” I’m entry number 171.
