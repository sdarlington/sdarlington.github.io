I got a new iPad to replace my 2018 iPad Pro. Let me complain about it first.

It bothers me that it’s a computer, yet I can’t easily write my own software on it[^writesoft]. Sure, there is [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/), but I don’t really want to use Swift. And even if I did, it’s not a _proper_ IDE, it doesn’t support basic features like a debugger. It’s not [1985 any more](https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk). There are other languages ([Pythonista](https://www.omz-software.com/pythonista/) looks good, though I’ve not tried it), but the vast array of languages that are available on Linux and on the Mac are missing.

In recent years I’ve done part of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), and each time I pick a different language[^langauges]. At best, an iPad limits my options. Maybe my best choice is to `ssh` into a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/), but that seems like a crazy limitation for a £1000+ computer.

And then there’s the £1000+ part. When iPad first came out, people were genuinely surprised with the £499 price tag. Rumours were that the launch price would be double that. Yes, there are iPads much cheaper than the Pro, but I’ve been spoiled.

By “spoiled,” I mean that I’ve had Face ID to authenticate me since 2018, and I don’t want to go back. Would an iPad Air do everything I need? Almost certainly. Honestly, the iPad would do the trick most of the time. But neither of those has Face ID.

As much as it has advanced, I would not consider everything on the new model to be an upgrade. What I like about the original Smart Folio was that it was a good _enough_ keyboard that also served as a case and was fairly light. The new keyboard is great -- a real laptop feel -- but is heavy. I don’t want to lug it around everywhere.

In summary, despite being expensive, it’s surprisingly limited and requires a bunch of pricey “add ons” to make it functional.

Yet, despite all that I still love my iPad. I can’t competently explain why. It’s not entirely rational.

There’s something about picking up a thin slab of glass and interacting with it using your fingers that feels intuitive and like the future.

Compared with my 2018 model, there’s not much to note. The specs are better, sure. The software is vastly improved[^software]. It’s still well made with a beautiful screen.

But that’s not what makes the iPad compelling. It’s some ineffable _niceness_. Whether I’m reading the web, books or magazine, triaging email or writing blogs, the iPad is just... _pleasant_ to use. The hardware keeps out of the way quite unlike a laptop or desktop machine.

I can’t say it’s worth the money. I can’t run you through a feature checklist or point to any objective metrics. I could check my email or surf the web on a Chromebook for a fraction of the price. I just don’t want to. That makes me super-privileged but also pretty happy with my purchase.

[^writesoft]: Even _writing_ software for it is more involved than you’d like. For personal use it still needs you to juggle various certificates.

[^langauges]: What can I say: I’m a sucker for punishment.

[^software]: That line sells it short. iPadOS 26, with its proper multitasking, makes it dramatically more useful. It _ran_ on my old iPad but it’s _useful_ on my 2025 model.
