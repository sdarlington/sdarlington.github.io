This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Misty](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000741.php).” Here is my entry.

This picture was taken in [Norway](/travel/norway.html), just outside Oslo near the huge, scary ski jump. This is maybe more foggy than misty but you get the idea. Also, while this was taken on black and white film, there really wasn’t much more colour than this!

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[The Machine](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=739).” I’m entry number 207.
