This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[The Machine](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000739.php).” Here is my entry.

Clearly this is a bulldozer, *a* machine. What makes this *the* machine is that it was used in the [battle of Santa Clara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara%2C_Cuba#Battle_of_Santa_Clara) by Che Guevara’s victorious soldiers. Obviously this picture was taken in [Cuba](/travel/cuba.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Disastrous](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=737).” I’m entry number 140.
