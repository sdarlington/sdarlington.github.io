- [Apple iPhone Developers Mostly Don't Make Much Money](http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/iphone/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217801029) – "Martin surveyed 100 development teams, received 85 usable responses, and found that 52% of the developers had earned less than $15,000 for their efforts and 33% earned less than $250." Missed this one when it was first published. Bizarre to think that I'm doing better than a third of other iPhone developers!

- [Don't call what happened in Iran last week an election](http://www.slate.com/id/2220520/) – Christopher Hitchens' take on the recent events in Iran.
