This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Constructed](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001239.php).” Unfortunately, while this picture may *look* appropriate I should probably tell you that I’m cheating. This image is, in fact, of the demolition, the *de*construction, of a car park near where I live.
