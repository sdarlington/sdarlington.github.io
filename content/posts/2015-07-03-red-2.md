This weeks PhotoFriday theme is “[Red](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1517).” My entry is a Ferrari because what other colour are you going to one in? (Actually, I didn’t drive this one. The one I *did* drive was a front-engined GT and it was… white.)

Incidentally, this isn’t the first time “Red” has been the PhotoFriday challenge. Last time I used a picture from [Cuba](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/red.html).
