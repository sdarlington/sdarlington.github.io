- [Google Android Personal Thoughts](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2010/01/09/google-android-personal-thoughts/) – "Uniformity is not a word you’ll find in Android’s dictionary. How about the fact that the application icons aren’t the same size. Uh, why? Since there’s no transparent padding around the icons … there’s no uniformity in the touch areas when you go to tap on an icon." These things probably don't seem important to Google but the attention to detail is what makes the iPhone (usually) a pleasure to use. I've not used an Android handset but these things would bug me pretty quickly.
