If you’re subscribed to my RSS feeds you may well have noticed already, but I have started, as an experiment, adding interesting links to my [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/ "del.icio.us") account and syndicating them from here. Is that a good idea? What do you think?

If, on the other hand, that first paragraph made no sense, read on.

First, let me explain terms. [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss) stands for “Really Simple Syndication” and is a way to get your web browser ((Yes, there are programs that do this specifically. And programs like Outlook can read RSS feeds too. However I think most people still use a browser.)) to tell you when a website changes. If you have [Internet Explorer 7](http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ "Honestly, you're probably better off using something else") you should see the feeds icon (an orange square with white lines) next to the home icon on the top right, just below the search text box. In [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/ "My browser of choice") the bar with the URL will have a blue RSS icon to the right. And [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com "Firefox") has “Live Bookmarks” which do the same thing. Simply click the appropriate button and see what happens.

And if your browser does not support RSS — time you upgraded! — there are a couple of other ways of catching up. Look to the right of your screen and you’ll see buttons to add ZX81.org.uk to your “[My Yahoo!](http://my.yahoo.com)” or to your [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) or [Personalised Google Home Page](http://www.google.com/ig/). And, if that wasn’t enough, you can also subscribe by email ((Really, there’s no escape. You may as well give in now.)).

If you do that you’ll see brief articles there that you won’t see here, where “here” is directly on the zx81.org.uk website.

And del.icio.us? That’s basically just a website where you can share interesting links with your friends. I’ve just made it easy by merging my bookmarks with the ZX81.org.uk RSS feed.
