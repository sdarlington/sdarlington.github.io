When I think of “[Stillness](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1464),” this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, I tend to think of a lake; an apparently unmoving body of water. (A lot of the other entries, to my eyes at least, don’t represent “Stillness.” Of course, mine may well miss the mark for them…)

Whatever its merits, this one was taken near Spooner Lake, which is very near [Lake Tahoe](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/lake-tahoe.html "Lake Tahoe").

I didn’t have an entry in the last challenge, so there’s no need to vote for me(!).

Incidentally, there was another PhotoFriday challenge with the theme “Stillness.” You can see my previous entry [here](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/stillness.html). Tragically, I nearly used the same image again!
