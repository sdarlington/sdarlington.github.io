[![Italian white wine bottle](https://i0.wp.com/farm2.staticflickr.com/1394/5169649813_8c0940cb66.jpg?resize=500%2C332)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5169649813/ "Italian white wine bottle by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

Again, I’m not quite happy with this image. It’s *close* to the theme “[Liquid](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001032.php),” which is this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, but, to me, isn’t exactly right. As you can see, it’s a [bottle of white wine](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/a-lot-of-bottle.html) that I took a couple of years ago.

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/dark.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Dark](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1030).” I’m entry number 136.
