It’s been a while since I’ve entered the PhotoFriday challenge, but I liked this weeks theme — “[Body of Water](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1296)” — and thought I had a good image for it. This was taken a couple of years ago in [Lake Tahoe](/travel/lake-tahoe.html "Lake Tahoe"), California.
