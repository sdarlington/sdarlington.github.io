Only a fool would go to Norway as the winter approaches. I was told this by just about everyone that I spoke to.

Even the Norwegians said that Autumn was the worst time to visit. In the summer it’s comfortably warm and there’s beautiful country-side you can appreciate in any number of ways. In winter, it’s sharp, bright, covered in snow and beautifully clear. Autumn is just grey, dull and rainy.

In my eight months there I saw Autumn, which was much more beautiful than they claimed, winter, which wasn’t anywhere near as bad as I expected, and the start of summer. I took a mass of film of all seasons, and these are the highlights.

				</script>All these pictures have been taken on my EOS300. The first few pictures were taken on Kodak Royal Gold ISO100, then there are a few on Fuji Superia ISO100, the black and white ones are on Ilford XP2 ISO400 and all those from Tromsø onwards are on Sensia II 100 slide film.

If the pictures have piqued your interest, there are a few web Sites that you might want to visit:

- [Norwegian Tourist Board](http://www.visitnorway.com/). Lots of interesting stuff.
- [Norwegian State Railways.](http://www.nsb.no/) Check timetables on-line.
- You’re going to need a guide while travelling around Norway. As always, there’s a Lonely Planet guide. You can buy a copy from Amazon ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/174059200X/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/174059200X/zx81orguk00)).
- I also used the Insight Guide to Scandinavia (mainly for my trip to Stockholm), but the Lonely Planet guide was better. If I’ve not put you off, you can buy a copy from [Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/981234571X/zx81orguk) (not available at Amazon.com). Oddly enough, this book was cheaper to buy in Norway than back in London.
