This HOWTO business has got slightly out of hand! There are so many different versions of Oracle and Linux that I’ve been forced to do a little restructuring.

This table should explain the documents that you need. Generally you need the main HOWTO (to answer any questions you might have) and the errata. If you know what you’re doing you might be able to get away with just the errata.

| ? | **Oracle 8i R1 (8.1.5)** | **Oracle 8i R2 (8.1.6)** | **Oracle 8i R3 (8.1.7)** | **Oracle 9i** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Redhat 6.x** | [HOWTO](howto.html) | [Errata](install816.html) | [Errata](install817.html) | (Not supported) |
| **RedHat 7.x** | [Errata](redhat7.html) | [Errata](redhat7.html) | [Errata](redhat7.html) | [Guide](install901.html) |
| **RedHat 8.x** | [Errata](redhat8.html) | [Errata](redhat8.html) | [Errata](redhat8.html) | [Guide](install901.html) |

Other distributions are generally just like RedHat, assuming they have the same glibc and kernel versions.
