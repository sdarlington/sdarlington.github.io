[![Hills over Bergen, Norway](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5041/5195616272_e9b92e16b2.jpg?resize=500%2C334)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5195616272/ "Hills over Bergen, Norway by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

One of the great things about [Norway](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/norway.html) is that you’re never very far from the country-side. Even in Oslo you’re only twenty minutes on the t-bane from Nordmarka. I couldn’t find a picture of that that I was happy with, though, so I went for the above image taken overlooking Bergen (the fjord capital of Norway).
