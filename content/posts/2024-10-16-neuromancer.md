*Part of the [Twenty Books in Twenty Days](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/twenty-books.html) series.*

“[Neuromancer](https://amzn.to/4eGyKAQ)” \[affiliate link\] probably needs no introduction. I may not reference it as often as [Hitchhikers Guide](https://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy.html), but if you know *anything* about me, I doubt you’d be surprised that I include it here.

When I first read it, I’d not used, maybe never even *heard* of, the Internet. I’m not sure I’ll ever be ready to plug my brain into a computer but the idea of a global computer-based hallucination is something we now all experience every day. Maybe not *exactly* as Gibson wrote. Well, hopefully not.

Probably the aspect that worked for me at the time was that it made computers *cool*. Being into computers at that time was definitely not cool. I’m not sure that ever bothered me a huge amount. I’ve never really chased being cool. (Probably just as well.) But a fiction where it *is* is obviously alluring at some level.
