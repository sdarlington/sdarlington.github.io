[![Camel Handler, Wadi Rum, Jordan](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3782/10817484206_b095e18f05.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817484206/ "Camel Handler, Wadi Rum, Jordan by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This chap is a *professional* camel handler that led my animal, dancing, singing and laughing all the way through [Wadi Rum](/travel/jordan-wadi-rum.html) in [Jordan](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html). This weeks PhotoFriday theme being “[Professional](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000771.php)” I thought this image was appropriate.

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[My Little Secret](/photography/photofriday/my-little-secret.html).” I’m [entry number 185](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=769).
