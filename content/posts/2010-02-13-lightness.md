I had a really hard time finding a suitable image for this weeks PhotoFriday theme, “[Lightness](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000955.php).” I note that a few people have submitted sunsets or sunrises. Nice, but that’s *light* not light*ness*.

[I visited Iceland](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/iceland.html) over Christmas and remember the constant flickering of candles and open fires and the cheer of the locals despite the long hours of darkness. This image, therefore, represents lightness both in terms of the candles and the spirit of all in the parade. (That sort of sounds cheesy when you write it down but I’m being genuine when I say it!)

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/surfaces.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Surfaces](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=953).” I’m entry number 195.
