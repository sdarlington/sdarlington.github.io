- [Galileo’s telescope reaches 400th anniversary](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/aug/25/galileos-telescope-400-years-anniversary) – "Exactly 400 years ago today, on 25 August 1609, the Italian astronomer and philosopher Galilei Galileo showed Venetian merchants his new creation, a telescope – the instrument that was to bring him both scientific immortality and, more immediately, a whole lot of trouble."
