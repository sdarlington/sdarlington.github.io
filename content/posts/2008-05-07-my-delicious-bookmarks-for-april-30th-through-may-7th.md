- [Senator to ISPs: "Think twice" about 'Net neutrality… or else](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080506-senator-to-isps-think-twice-about-net-neutrality-or-else.html) – It's encouraging that some politicians understand the issues of net neutrality. Let's hope that there are also tech-savvy MPs here in the UK.
- [Peep Show for free!](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?i=279473098&id=279134555&s=143444) – If you're in the UK this is a must-have download: the first episode of the new series of Peep Show. It's perhaps the best comedy show on British TV at the moment. Highly recommended.
- [The Free Web: 15 Years Old Today](http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2008/04/free-web-15-years-old-today.html) – The subject line says it all! Where would we be without the web?
