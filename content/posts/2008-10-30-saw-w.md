![Saw W](https://i0.wp.com/www.zx81.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/saw-w.jpg?resize=304%2C450 "Saw W")

George W. Bush stars in the latest (and little publicised) in the gory [Saw](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132626/) movie franchise. In it he discovers some interesting new “[enhanced interrogation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_interrogation_techniques)” techniques and finds that getting out, with no recourse to legal representation or trial, is, quite literally, torture.
