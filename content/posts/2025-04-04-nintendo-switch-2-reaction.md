The clue is in the name. Rather than a significant break from the past, the Switch 2 is an iteration. Bigger. Faster. Better. But not a revolution. 

That’s not a bad thing. Why break with a successful formula?

I’m not a big gamer. In fact, the [Switch is the first console I’ve bought](/posts/2017-07-15-nintendo-switch/). Let’s take a quick tour of the original, eight year old Switch and see what it got right and wrong. 

The form factor is good, but there are quirks. The kickstand deserves a good kicking. The joycons have their infamous reliability issues. It’s way too easy to put the wrist-straps on the wrong way round.

The UI is okay. Minimal, but pretty fast and easy to use. Software updates are fairly regular and quick to apply. But the online service is oddly limited. If you want to chat with the remote people you’re playing with, you can do it with the iPhone app in some games. Otherwise you’ll need to rely on FaceTime or WhatsApp. This is because the Switch doesn’t have a microphone. 

Real gamers will point at the specs and laugh. HD resolution. Anaemic processor and GPU.

But the games are fun. I spent _hours_ playing ARMS and Mario Odyssey and Mario Wonder. This may not sound impressive, but, as noted above, I’m not a gamer. Me spending _any_ time on a console game is unusual. One of the things I’ve enjoyed the most is that it’s not even a solitary thing. We play Sports and Mario Kart as a family. The kids play Lego Marvell Superheros and Minecraft together. When I was a kid, gaming was anti-social. No longer.

So, what of the Switch 2? Nintendo had an hour-long presentation earlier this week, but if you distil it down to the fundamentals, it’ll play most of the same games; it has a bigger screen; more reliable joycons; and a microphone. But it’s 50% more expensive.

That makes it sound like I’m underwhelmed. But I genuinely don’t mean it that way. We’ve got far more value out of the original Switch than I ever imagined and the new model is improved -- on paper at least -- by almost any metric you want to measure. I’m looking forward to seeing the hardware in person. The previews suggest that it’s as good as you might hope.
