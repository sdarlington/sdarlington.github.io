[![Boys in market, Aqaba, Jordan](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/10817743843_1d40b6cb8f.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817743843/ "Boys in market, Aqaba, Jordan by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

As with any “[Spontaneous](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000811.php)” picture, I could pick out a bunch of flaws in this image, yet I love the expressions on the boys faces. I found this situation in a market in [Aqaba, Jordan](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[The Extraordinary](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=809).” I’m entry number 264.
