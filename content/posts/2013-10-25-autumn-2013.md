[![Autumn](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/10479376454_f6dd8227f3.jpg?resize=375%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10479376454/ "Autumn by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

This weeks theme is “[Autumn 2013](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1339)” and while I was out on a quick walk this afternoon I spotted this pile of leaves. Nothing says “autumn” like leaves falling from trees and their colours.
