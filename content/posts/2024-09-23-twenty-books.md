I’ve been following and participating in the twenty books in twenty days [hashtag on Mastodon](https://mas.to/tags/20Books20Days). It’s described as follows:

> 20 books that have had an impact on who you are. One book a day for 20 days. No explanations, no reviews, just book covers.

I’m going to cheat. I am going to explain my choices. The posts that follow are all part of the challenge. As with my annual reading lists, these are not reviews *per se*, more notes, observations or thoughts that occur to me as I read them.

There have been some great books shared. My choices sometimes feel pedestrian by comparison. I did consider including more worthy choices but I stuck to being “honest,” even if it cost me some Internet Credibility Points.

I don’t recall who (sorry), but someone posted about Mondo 2000. I’ve not thought about it for years, but I loved it at the time. At least, when I could get hold of it. At the time it wasn’t something you could get just by going to your local newsagent.
