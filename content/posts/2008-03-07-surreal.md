I think a cow in a skirt could well be considered to be *surreal* and therefore makes a suitable candidate for this weeks [PhotoFriday challenge](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000752.php). This image was taken in [Paris](/travel/paris-2006.html).

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[Fuzzy](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=750).” I’m entry 179.
