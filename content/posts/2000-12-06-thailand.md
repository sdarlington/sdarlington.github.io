Thailand is such a beautiful country that I could help but take a huge number of pictures. What you can see here represents the good fraction of those taken!

We started in Bangkok, got the night-train up to Chang Mai and a boat up to Chiang Rai. From there we mini-bused and walked through some Hill Tribe villages back to Chiang Mai, Bangkok and then flew home. A tiring couple of weeks, but well worth it for the scenery alone.

Note that the spelling of many Thai places are not strictly standardised. Iâ€™ve used the spellings that our tour-guide or my Lonely Planet guide used, but you may well see others.

If the pictures have piqued your interest, there are a few web sites that you might want to visit:

- [Lonely Planet](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/south_east_asia/thailand/) have a useful guide to Thailand, including a large number of interesting links.
- If you prefer hard-copy (much more portable than your laptop!), you can buy a copy from Amazon ([UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864502517/zx81orguk) or [US](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864502517/zx81orguk00)).
- Some of the above pictures were taken in some of the northern Hilltribe villages. [This](http://www.infothai.com/wtcmcr/hiltribe.htm) web site gives some useful information about them.
