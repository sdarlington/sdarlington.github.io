[![Changing of the guard, Royal Palace](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5056/5540274182_7174e4fda8.jpg?resize=333%2C500)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/5540274182/ "Changing of the guard, Royal Palace by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

With a startling lack of originality, I present my entry in this weeks PhotoFriday challenge, “[Polished](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001067.php).” I say unoriginal as it’s a pretty literal interpretation of the theme and it’s also an image I used for an earlier PhotoFriday (“[Shiny](/photography/photofriday/shiny.html)“). It was taken in [Stockholm, Sweden](/travel/stockholm-sweden.html).

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/ethereal.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Ethereal](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1065).” I’m entry number 173.
