- [New Zealand Launches Hookup Airways](http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/05/hook-up-airway) – Not sure whether this is a good idea or a bit creepy. An intercontinental flight is a long time to spend cooped up with a bad date!
- [Scientists put psychic's paranormal claims to the test](http://www.reasonproject.org/newsfeed/item/scientists_put_psychics_paranormal_claims_to_the_test/) – If you can prove a paranormal claim under controlled conditions you can win $1mm. The prize has gone unclaimed since the 1960's.
- [A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html) – "Bjarne Stroustrup bolts everything he's ever heard of onto C to create C++. The resulting language is so complex that programs must be sent to the future to be compiled by the Skynet artificial intelligence." Despite the title I'd say it's mostly correct, and funny if you're geeky enough to understand the references!
