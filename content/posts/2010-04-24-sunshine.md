It’s spring in the UK so you can only imagine the difficulty I had finding a suitable recent image for this weeks PhotoFriday, “[Sunshine](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000975.php).”

In the end I went back a couple of years to when we were in Egypt. This picture is from a rather stormy day in [Alexandria](/travel/egypt-alexandria.html). As you can see, the sun broke through the clouds with spectacular results.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/wheels.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Wheels](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=973).” I’m entry number 193.
