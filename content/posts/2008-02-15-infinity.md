[![View over Wadi Rum, Jordan](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/10817479726_55a79ab654.jpg?resize=500%2C333)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/10817479726/ "View over Wadi Rum, Jordan by stephendarlington, on Flickr")

The desert is so vast, stretching off as far as the eye can see in every direction, that from a human scale it appears to be infinite. Which is fortunate as that is this weeks [PhotoFriday theme](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000746.php). This image was taken in [Wadi Rum](/travel/jordan-wadi-rum.html), [Jordan](/travel/jordan-and-egypt.html).
