- [Cameron Todd Willingham, Texas, and the death penalty](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann?currentPage=all) – I find that there are many convincing arguments against capital punishment but maybe it's the emotional one that works in the end. It could be you?
- [Why do some countries drive on the right and others on the left?](<http://users.telenet.be/worldstandards/driving on the left.htm>) – Fascinating look at why (and where) we drive on which side of the road.
- [Hidden Developer Gems in Snow Leopard](http://waffle.wootest.net/2009/08/28/hidden-developer-gems-in-snow-leopard/) – I know it's geeky but I'm more excited about the new APIs in Snow Leopard than any of the new stuff or even, to a certain extent, the performance improvements.
