I confess that I was very tempted to roll out one of my [old favourite autumnal pictures](/photography/photofriday/autumn.html) but in the end I actually went out with my camera and took the above image. This was literally taken just outside my flat. The golden light and the yellowing leaves say “[Autumn 2009](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000923.php)” to me. Obviously for the true British Autumn we’d also need some rain.

Please also vote for [my entry](/photography/photofriday/is-in-the-details.html) in last weeks challenge, “[…Is In The Details](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=921).” I’m entry number 175.
