As anyone who knows me can attest, “[Dawn](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000919.php)” is not a time that you’re likely to see me awake, much less running around with a camera. That made this weeks PhotoFriday a bit of a challenge.

In the end I picked this shot from the top of [Mount Sinai](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/egypt-mount-sinai.html). It perhaps represents “sunrise” better than “dawn” but it was certainly taken at dawn!

Please also vote for [my entry](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/photofriday/fast-food.html) in last weeks challenge, “[Fast Food](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=917).” I’m entry number 123.
