[![Sagrada Familia](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7046/8688378707_28f4dd2b39.jpg?resize=500%2C333&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/stephendarlington/8688378707 "Sagrada Familia by Stephen Darlington, on Flickr")

Last year we went to [Barcelona](http://www.zx81.org.uk/travel/barcelona.html "Barcelona") and visited the Sagrada Familia, Gaudi’s amazing, unfinished cathedral. The organ was beautiful but it was difficult to get a picture of, until I realised the [Reflection](http://www.photofriday.com/challenge.php?id=1385) — this weeks PhotoFriday theme — of the stained glass window worked pretty well. (Don’t tell anyone, but my wife [zoomed in closer and got a better image that I did](http://www.brandarling.com/2013/04/barcelona.html).)

Please also vote for my entry in last weeks challenge, “[My obsession](http://www.photofriday.com/linkviewer.php?id=1383).” I’m entry number 56.
