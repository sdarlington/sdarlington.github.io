“[Sharp Focus](http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/001097.php)” is a surprisingly hard theme to find a good image to represent. A picture that was just *sharp* wouldn’t look much different from most other pictures. So, ironically, to show something in sharp focus you really need some contrast, namely some background blur. This picture, you can possibly guess, was taken last year at the top of the [Eiffel Tower](/travel/paris-part-deux.html).
