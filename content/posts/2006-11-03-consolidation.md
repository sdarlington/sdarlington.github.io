[As I mentioned previously](http://www.zx81.org.uk/news/major-site-update.html "Old news..."), I am in the process of reducing the number of websites that I need to support. To that end, some time ago I moved the content from StephenDarlington.com to here with the intention of decommisioning the old site. That day is coming shortly. The actual domain isn’t going away for a while yet, but soon it will redirect to [www.zx81.org.uk/blog/](http://www.zx81.org.uk/blog/ "The new destination for people looking for stephendarlington.com").

Similarly, DarlingtonPhotography.com is going to go away too, to be replaced by [www.zx81.org.uk/photography/](http://www.zx81.org.uk/photography/ "The new destination for people looking for darlingtonphotography.com"). In the next few weeks I will be transitioning the content, and shorly after that the site itself will vanish too.

Why am I doing this? Well, the short story is that it’s a pain having to maintain three distinct systems. It makes the most sense to stick to ZX81 as is already gets the most page impressions and has a bizarre mix of technology, opinion and travel photography. What difference is a few more pictures of people going to make?
