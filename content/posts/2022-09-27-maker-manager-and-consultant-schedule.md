<span style="font-size: revert;">Have you heard about the </span>[Maker Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)<span style="font-size: revert;">? The idea resonated as it explained a lot about my productivity.</span>

For the uninitiated, here are how the two types are defined.

> The manager’s schedule is \[where\] each day \[is\] cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you’re doing every hour.

The Maker’s schedule, on the other hand:

> \[Makers\] generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.

The challenge I have is that I’m neither a maker nor a manager. As a “consultant”<sup>[1](#fn1-23058 "see footnote")</sup> I fall somewhere between the two. The variety is what makes it interesting to me. The variety is also what makes it difficult.

Sometimes I have to sit and concentrate for a large block of time. Maybe I’m sketching out an architecture, researching something, building a prototype, or debugging some code. Perhaps I’m writing a report or putting together a presentation.

On other days I have back-to-back meetings. Workshops, delivering presentations or training, and explaining the results of my research.

But the worst are days where I have an hour’s meeting followed by an hour “gap,” repeated. Technically, I’m only in meetings for half the time, but it wipes out the whole day in terms of productivity. I spend half the day either context switching or with a tranche of time that’s too small to do much useful. A few days of these meetings and I feel very *busy* but not very *productive*.

The internet is full of suggestions on how to manage your schedule correctly. Few of them work for me.

A popular suggestion is to schedule meetings together, always in the morning or late in the day, for example. But what if I have clients in India and colleagues in the US? (I do.) There can be meetings at any time, and timezones mean that I can’t reasonably move them. I do have a certain amount of latitude in terms of moving some meetings around, but there are constraints beyond my productivity. If I (an individual) am trying to set up a workshop with half-a-dozen people *and* they’re paying for the privilege of meeting me, I’m at a disadvantage, schedule-wise.

Another suggestion is to block out the time in my calendar. This is probably the most effective method, but it’s not without its challenges. It’s hard to ‘hold the line’ against people booking meetings. Whether it’s someone not knowing how to check your calendar (or them not caring), frequently pushing back when you have no other firm commitments can look like you’re not a “team player.”

Another reason it’s hard to keep those time blocks is that it can be hard to know how long they need to be. Consultants usually have to maximise “billable time,” which makes it hard to turn down sure-fire client-facing hours. If I block out four hours in my diary, what’s to say I won’t get stuck after an hour and have to wait for feedback? What do I then do with the remaining three hours? It’s a real optimisation and opportunity cost problem.

So what’s the answer? I wish I had the One True Way. I’m not sure that one exists. Unlike many of the other people giving advice on the internet<sup>[2](#fn2-23058 "see footnote")</sup>, I am not 100% in control of my schedule. The best I’ve been able to come up with is a combination of all of the above. I *try* to have meeting-free days. I *try* to block time where it makes sense.

To an extent, it’s my job to be flexible and available for clients. Maybe I just need to learn to live with it?
