I’ve read a lot of Moren’s words over the years, but mostly in Macworld and [Six Colors](https://sixcolors.com)[^1]. I picked “[The Caledonian Gambit](https://amzn.to/3Tp6NV6)[^2]” entirely arbitrarily. 

His fiction is... fine. It’s a bit too military to my taste, but with a bunch of spy and action for good measure. There’s some family backstory that feeds into it, leading to a well rounded story. It didn’t fully engage me but I did keep reading, and wanted to know how it ended. There were a few phrases where I thought “he’s trying too hard” but, otherwise, it’s well written.

In summary, there’s nothing wrong with it. It just wasn’t for me. Sorry, Dan.
