Most people that know me are aware that I tend to favour the Macintosh over Microsoft Windows. One of the problems with maintaining such a position is that people are always saying how much more expensive Apple products are. While I realise that a single example is not likely to change that, maybe people should look at this [Windows XP Media Center PC](http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33641) before throwing stones. A snip at [?5,980,000.00](http://www.mcscom.co.uk/product.php?xProd=2191&xSec=37&jssCart=f180de1c995c72281ac3557f33076a75).

If anyone wants to buy me a Mac Pro and a 30″ monitor with their change I won’t argue.
