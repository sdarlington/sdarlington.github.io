- [Apple Answers the FCC’s Questions](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/apple-answers-fcc-questions/) – A few interesting tidbits, including the fact that two reviewers look at every update, but I'd say that there was little of real substance here.
- [The brutal truth about America’s healthcare](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-brutal-truth-about-americarsquos-healthcare-1772580.html) – "But the truth is that the rich, and the insurance firms, just don't realise what we are going through, or simply don't care. Look around this room and tell me that America's healthcare don't need fixing." Still finding the whole debate quite bizarre.
