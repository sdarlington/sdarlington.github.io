- [Ex-BBC DJ Greening dies aged 44](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7165356.stm) – Kevin Greening was the best thing to happen to the Radio 1 Breakfast Show for years. Shame he only lasted a year. Very sad to hear of his premature death.
- [The Megapixel Myth](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm) – More on the myth that more megapixels makes better pictures.
- [Ban helps more smokers quit habit](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7160622.stm) – It wasn’t until I went to The Netherlands last week that I remembered how nasty and smoky British pubs and restaurants used to be.
