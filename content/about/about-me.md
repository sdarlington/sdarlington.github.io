Hi, I'm Stephen. I've had this website and this domain longer than many readers have been alive. I first used the internet in the early nineties. Technically after Berners-Lee had invented the web, though before it was obviously going to be big. Clairvoyant that I am, I thought that [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) had more potential at the time.

I'm into technology, travel, music, humanism and politics. I write about some of those things more than others.

I work for a software company, and much of what I write about the industry is based on my experience there. Most pieces are not literal. Some are exaggerated to make a point. Others are an amalgamation of various events. Any resemblance to real events is purely coincidental, as they say in the movies.

I live in London, UK, with my wife and two kids. We have no pets. I'm still bitter about [Brexit](/posts/2020-01-31-brexit/).
